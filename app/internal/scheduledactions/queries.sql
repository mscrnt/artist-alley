-- Only a PENDING action can be cancelled — a done/failed/cancelled one
-- is terminal. Guarding on state='pending' makes cancel idempotent and

-- silently succeeding on an already-fired action.

-- name: ClaimDueAction :one
-- The reaper's claim. One pending action whose time has come, oldest
-- first, row-locked so overlapping reaper runs never grab the same one.
-- SKIP LOCKED means a second reaper moves on to the next due action
-- instead of blocking. The caller executes + marks within the SAME
-- transaction that holds this lock, so no intermediate "executing"
-- state is needed.

-- The author seam (#1119 sprint 21e). An author's own publication
-- schedule is an ordinary change_state/post row with origin = 'author';
-- every query here is scoped to that origin AND to the row's creator,
-- so this surface can neither see nor touch an operator's or the
-- system's instruction for the same post. See migration 00069 for the
-- partial unique index that keeps one pending author row per post.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- name: CreateAuthorPostPublication :one
-- Inserts the author's standing instruction. The unique index
-- scheduled_actions_author_pending_post_idx raises 23505 when another
-- pending author row for the post exists; the Store maps that to
-- ErrAuthorScheduleConflict rather than checking first.

-- this statement even when it targets the same post.

-- name: ExecAssetChangeSensitivity :one
-- Flips an asset's sensitivity tier and returns the PREVIOUS value so

-- soft-deleted; the executor treats that as a failure, not a silent
-- no-op.

-- name: ExecAssetSoftDelete :execrows
-- Soft-delete (set deleted_at); the nightly GC hard-deletes later. Only
-- acts on a live row, so re-running against an already-deleted asset is
-- a no-op the executor reports as rows-affected=0.
--
-- deleted_by_user_ref is the scheduled action's `created_by`, which is
-- itself nullable — a system-scheduled retention delete has no human
-- behind it. NULL there means "nobody may self-restore this", which is
-- the correct fail-closed answer rather than a gap (#931).
