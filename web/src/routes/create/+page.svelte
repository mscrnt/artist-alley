  // The full-page create surface (#1119 slice 1), at `/create`.
  //
  // ⚠️ NOT `/posts/new`. That was the first spelling and it made
  // the upload modal's link to this page — which lives in the root
  // layout, so it is in the DOM everywhere — the first match for
  // `a[href^="/posts/"]`, the locator ten dogfood cases use to find
  // a post card. Invisible and first is the worst combination: three
  // specs spent 30s each clicking a link they could not see. A create
  // URL that cannot be confused with a post permalink is the fix.
  //
  // ## What this is, and what it is not
  //
  // It REPLACES the upload modal for composing a post properly, and it
  // does not retire it: the modal stays as the quick path and both
  // surfaces drive the same store. Nothing about the pipeline is new
  // here — bytes, asset rows, field values, companions and post
  // creation are all upload.svelte.ts's, unchanged. What is new is the
  // page, and two things it is the first consumer of.
  //
  // ## ⛔ THE FRICTION LINE GOVERNS AND IS NOT NEGOTIABLE
  //
  // From empty: drop a file, press Publish. TWO actions, and no field
  // the artist did not choose to fill. Every section below that is not
  // those two is progressive — a disclosure, or an optional control
  // with a working default. The reference design ASKS a lot; this one
  // OFFERS a lot and REQUIRES almost nothing.
  //
  // That is why:
  //   - the post is created unconditionally (no "also make a post?"
  //     checkbox to find and tick),
  //   - the title is optional,
  //   - visibility and publish-status carry the defaults the modal
  //     already used,
  //   - and the Publish button is live the moment one file is ready.
  //
  // ## First consumer #1: `show_on_upload`
  //
  // #1173 gave every field a participation flag and nothing outside the
  // admin editor ever read it. This page does, via
  // `fieldsOfferedOnUpload`. Participation is OPT-OUT — absent or true
  // means offered — so an install that has never configured a field
  // sees exactly what it saw before.
  //
  // ## First consumer #2: the REAL asset type
  //
  // The modal asks for `fieldsForAssetType(1)` with the comment
  // "// Photo for MVP": one hardcoded type for every file, whatever it
  // is. The fix is NOT to mirror the server's extension table in the
  // browser — that table (`assetTypeFor`, assets/handler.go) is the
  // rule, and a copy of a rule is a second rule free to disagree with
  // the first. So this page ASKS: `POST /assets` returns the type the
  // server assigned, the store records it on the row, and the fields
  // offered are the ones for that type. Files of different types in one
  // drop each get their own set.
  //
  // ## Scheduling rides the scheduled-action engine (sprint 21e)
  //
  // #1119 says scheduled publish "rides the ADR 0020 scheduled-actions
  // machinery", and since #1238 the engine's `change_state` arm reaches
  // a post through the publication core. This page's third action makes
  // the post as a DRAFT and then records the author's standing
  // instruction against it (`PUT /posts/{id}/publication-schedule`); the
  // reaper publishes it on its next pass after the chosen time. Two
  // requests, and the second can fail after the first succeeded: see
  // `scheduleFailure` below for why that is reported and never retried
  // from here.
  //
  // The two-action path is untouched. Scheduling is a disclosure the
  // artist opens; Publish and Save as draft are the same two buttons.
