// Upload store — runed singleton, owns the upload modal's state.
//
// Design goals (locked in the Phase 1.13.D-2b plan):
//   1. The progress bar IS the upload. The moment a file appears in
//      the queue the runner starts pushing bytes. No "click upload"
//      step; the click that opens the modal is the only commit.
//   2. Drag files anywhere on the page → modal opens with the files
//      pre-loaded. Listeners are global, mounted once by the layout.
//   3. Background uploading. Closing the modal does NOT abort
//      in-flight uploads — they finish in the background; queued
//      files that haven't started are dropped (the user changed
//      their mind before any byte left the wire).
//   4. Per-file state machine. Reactive at the file level so
//      changing one row's title doesn't trigger a list-wide
//      re-render.
//
// The runner uses XMLHttpRequest because `fetch` still doesn't
// expose upload-progress events as of writing. Concurrency cap of 3
// is empirical — enough to saturate a typical home upstream without
// stalling slow connections behind faster ones.

   *
   * ## What changed
   *
   * A batch with NO model file behaves exactly as before, every file
   * is a row, immediately. That is the ordinary upload and it must not
   * acquire a delay or a decision.
   *
   * A batch WITH a model file splits: the models become rows and start
   * uploading at once, and the rest are HELD as candidates. Holding is
   * the point: a texture that has already become an asset cannot be
   * un-become one, so the decision has to happen before the bytes are
   * committed to an asset row. Nothing is held for long: the models are
   * uploading in parallel and the batch reconciles as soon as they have
