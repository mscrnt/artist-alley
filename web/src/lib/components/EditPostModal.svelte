  // THE POST EDITOR (#1119): the author-facing surface "Edit post" has
  // pointed at since the post menu was built.
  //
  // # What was here before
  //
  // A `stubAction()` alert saying the feature was coming soon. Every
  // column this dialog writes has been accepted by `PATCH /posts/{id}` for
  // sprints (title, description, visibility, tags, the cover and its focal
  // pair) and no shipped client sent that request except the cover dialog, which sent
  // three of them. So an author who wanted to fix a typo in a published
  // title had the API and no product.
  //
  // # It is EditCollectionModal's shape, deliberately
  //
  // ADR 0091's one-editing-surface ruling, and #1264's reading of it:
  // "I really think we shouldn't have more than one menu to edit
  // collections. We can put all editing of collection items, including
  // all cover types, in that same modal." The post menu had grown the
  // same pair the collection menu had, a real "Cover and framing…"
  // beside a stubbed "Edit post…", so the cover becomes a SECTION here
  // exactly as CollectionCoverEditor is a section there, its own menu
  // item goes, and there is one Save for the whole surface.
  //
  // Everything that made the collection version correct is carried
  // across rather than rediscovered:
  //
  //   * THE SNAPSHOT (#1262). The `post` prop is a live view of the
  //     host's copy of the row and the host refetches into it. While
  //     this dialog is open that is a second author writing into the
  //     surface the first one is typing in, and the concurrency baseline
  //     is the worst thing for it to touch: re-seeding
  //     `if_unchanged_since` from a refetch hands the dialog the
  //     timestamp of the very write it exists to detect. So the form,
  //     the baseline and every "was this set before I started?" guard
  //     read one snapshot taken on the OPEN EDGE.
  //   * THE TRI-STATES. A clear is a companion flag, never
  //     `x: null`, because a PATCH body distinguishes absent from null
  //     only if every reader agrees on the encoding. Each guard asks the
  //     SNAPSHOT whether the thing was already set, so a rename cannot
  //     send a clear for something a third party set thirty seconds ago.
  //
  // # ⛔ WHAT THIS DIALOG DOES NOT DO
  //
  //   * It does not write `state_id`. Published-or-draft is moved by
  //     `POST /posts/{id}/publish` / `unpublish` and nothing else (ADR
  //     0091 decisions 6 + 7): those run the workflow machine, its
  //     capability gate and its audit row, and they emit the Create /
  //     Delete a peer acts on. `PATCH /posts/{id}` deliberately drops
  //     `state_id` (#949, blocked on #895/#896/#897), so saving this
  //     form CANNOT publish a draft or unpublish a published post. The
  //     publication block below is the shipped endpoint, called
  //     directly, with its own button and its own busy state.
  //   * It does not schedule FROM SAVE. Scheduling is its own act in the
  //     publication block (#1119 sprint 21e): `PUT /posts/{id}/publication-
  //     schedule` records a standing instruction the scheduled-action
  //     engine carries out through the same publication core the
  //     Publish button reaches. Save cannot touch it, and the pending
  //     schedule shown there is read back from the server on every open,
  //     never remembered from the request that made it.
  //   * It does not ADD the post to a collection. CollectionPicker
  //     already does that from the same menu, and this section is the
  //     other half of the sentence: what is holding this post, and what
  //     the author can take it off.

  /** The cover half of the PATCH body, as exclusive branches.
   *
   *  THE SHIPPED RULES, and all three have to hold at once:
   *
   *  1. CHANGING THE COVER DISCARDS THE OLD FRAMING (#1333). A focal
   *     pair is a fraction of ONE picture's width and height, so it
   *     means nothing on the next one. The server nulls the pair when
   *     `cover_asset_id` arrives without one, so branch 2 sends no clear
   *     and needs none.
   *  2. SAVING A FRAMING PINS THE COVER. A post with no explicit
   *     `cover_asset_id` shows its FIRST MEMBER, a picture that can
   *     change under it: reorder the members and the cover moves,
   *     carrying a fraction chosen against the old one. So the picture a
   *     framing was chosen against is written down beside it. Nothing
   *     the author can see changes: what they framed is what the card
   *     was already showing.
   *  3. A CLEAR IS A FLAG, never `cover_focal_x: null`, and sending it
   *     alongside the pair is a 400 rather than a silent precedence
   *     rule. Hence exclusive branches.
   *
   *  ⛔ AND THE FOURTH, WHICH IS THIS SURFACE'S OWN. The cover section is
   *  on screen for every edit now, not behind its own menu item, so
   *  "always send `cover_asset_id`" would make renaming a post pin its
   *  cover, a write the author did not ask for, which is exactly what
   *  EditCollectionModal's `seeded.*` guards exist to prevent. The guards
   *  here ask the SNAPSHOT, so an untouched cover sends nothing at all.

<!-- ONE SURFACE, ONE WIDTH. The collection editor's `max-w-[min(96rem,
     95vw)]`, measured 1536px at 1080p, for the reason #1264 records:
     "big enough to judge a picture by" is a proportion of the screen, and
     a Tailwind size step on a 4k display is a cramped dialog with more
     whitespace around it. The cover marquee is the control that needs
     the width; everything else in here is a text field.

     WIDTH IS FIXED, HEIGHT IS DRIVEN BY CONTENT (#1220 + #1264). An
     ALLOCATED box a sparse form cannot fill is a dead band, so nothing
     inside takes a definite height: every region is content-sized under
     a cap, and the cap is the viewport minus the chrome. 12rem of chrome
     is MEASURED (header, footer, backdrop padding) rather than
     estimated. -->
