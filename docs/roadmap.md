## Foundation status

**Pre-v1.0 foundation is essentially complete.** Fifty-eight accepted
ADRs cover the load-bearing concerns: storage, caching, frontend
stack, federation protocol (walled-garden + encrypted, ArchivePub
v1.0 final), capability add-ons, audit log, observability, packaging,
migration baseline policy. The encryption arc (Phase 1.22.I) closed
the federation foundation. The pre-MVP cleanup (Phase 1.49) closed
the technical debt. The Phase 1.17 identity arc closed 2026-06-19
(tracker #20), completing the foundational arcs; its design record
is [ADR 0010](/adr/0010-permissions-teams-workflow/) (`accepted`).

The transition marker — the **v0.1.0 release tag**, the first-ever
tag — shipped 2026-07-11, followed by the v0.1.1 patch on 2026-07-13;
the second milestone (v1.0.0 = out of beta) sits further out.
Per [ADR 0046](/adr/0046-migration-baseline-and-squash-policy/)
squash point #1 executed at the tag (single baseline migration, ADR
0057); the append-only-forever trigger resolved to v1.0.0
(2026-07-11, resolves #228); details in
[docs/v0_1_readiness.md §0](./v0_1_readiness.md).

## Shipped

The current release stream covers the foundations:
### Releases

Full user-facing notes live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md). This table is the index.

| Version | Date | Headline |
|---|---|---|
| **v0.10.2** | 2026-08-18 | Seed coverage for mature content, and a cover editor that uses its room. The mature-content controls shipped in v0.10.0 but **nothing in the sample library was ever marked**, so the whole system was invisible on a fresh install — twelve public-domain classical works are now labelled, carried end-to-end by the seeder, and `asset.mature=true` is a required CI coverage dimension so the fixture cannot silently vanish (#1217, Kaggle republished). Plus the cover editor's page 2 spends the dialog instead of reserving it (#1218) |
| **v0.10.1** | 2026-08-17 | **The listening release** — thirty issues, every one found by using the app. Search waits for Enter and never suggests a dead end (#1155/#1156), Advanced Search speaks plainly and scales to real vocabularies (#1157/#1191), endless scrolling stays ahead of the reader after its trigger was found watching the wrong scroll container (#1159), grid tiles stop stretching the smallest rendition (#1169), the type filter sees inside posts (#1190), **public work became genuinely public** — the Public option had always been server-refused, and anonymous browsing now works end-to-end with every privacy rule verified on that path (#1176/#1181), collections hold posts only (#1185), the collection cover editor gained crop, zoom and separate card/strip covers (#1207/#1212), and every menu became keyboard-reachable including sign-out (#1109) |
| **v0.10.0** | 2026-08-16 | **The browse experience release** — the masonry wall rebuilt on explicit placement, every view given its own identity (#1047), mature content as a second axis orthogonal to clearance (ADR 0090), teams and tags as ways to read the feed, featured collections and operator promo strips, desktop-style bulk selection, and the search-withholding family closed: a work you cannot see stops answering through its title, suggestions, similarity, counts and covers alike |
| **v0.9.1** | 2026-08-11 | Security patch. `js-yaml` 4.3.0 → 4.3.1 in both lockfiles (#1038), closing two open high-severity advisories — quadratic CPU consumption resolving `!!omap`. Neither was covered by an open Dependabot PR: `js-yaml` is transitive via `cosmiconfig` and the patch was already inside the declared range, so this was a **stale lockfile resolution**, the same shape as `nanoid` in #1001 — the second time that shape has surfaced, and the reason "the remaining alerts will clear at the tag" is no longer an acceptable pre-flight answer. Plus the self-reported version bump (#1041) |
| **v0.9.0** | 2026-08-11 | User-facing surfaces, and the permission spine underneath them. Authorization became **one rule per plane**: a mutation capability confers the field plane but never the picture or the bytes (#939), publication is delegable one verb per transition (#938), team assignment runs through a single membership-gated rule (#954/#953), and a capability nobody can hold now fails CI (#958/#961). `UpdateAsset`/`DeleteAsset` had **no ownership gate at all** — closing that (#930) delivered team-scoped content management as a side effect. Deletion became **reversible and visible**: every account has a trash page with its recovery window (#937), all three delete affordances are live behind one confirm dialog with Undo (#981), and a restoration appeal is decided only by the deleter or a super-admin (#931). The surfaces that were half-built got finished — asset edit page (#549), a real social feed card with its author (#557), saving someone else's post to your collection (#882), teams as a browsable directory with channels (#684/#577), a page per field (#854), operator-chosen browse layouts (#709), and the view bar that comes back when you reach for it (#1020). Plus the OOM arc closed with measurement rather than guesswork (#888/#887/#890) and the account activity log that has no actor field by construction (#600) |
| **v0.8.0** | 2026-08-03 | Operator configuration — the admin config spine (epic #519): controlled vocabularies are editable (#328), a field can be a hierarchy with a nested-term tree editor (#779, #825), keywords grow by typing and from files (open vocabulary, #830/#831), rich-text fields render as formatted text (#816), any interface wording is rewritable without forking (site text, #794, ADR 0081 §1) as are all transactional emails (#795, ADR 0081 §2), and `fields.admin` is now a grantable capability (#804); internal release numbers no longer surface in the UI (#801); re-seeding an instance serves fresh data without a restart (#845); plus SSO credential read-hardening (#718) and a long tail of field-type, preview, and seed-fidelity fixes |
| **v0.7.0** | 2026-07-28 | Browse correctness, visibility security, and a real seed catalogue — five visibility leaks closed under one root cause (private posts readable by any signed-in user #660, ungated collections #661, anonymous `?tag=` exposing drafts #657, authenticated search 500ing #650, session IPs on the wrong capability #573; epic #665); Blender unpackaged, image 3.64GB → 1.82GB (#500, ADR 0069 amended); cards render correctly end to end (aspect ratios, append-stable masonry, blur-up for every asset type, honest `sizes`, designed no-preview tile); seed catalogue 1,007 → 1,946 assets with a 60-asset floor across 11 studios (#572, epic #562) |
| **v0.6.0** | 2026-07-23 | Public read surface + demo hardening — public user-profile pages (#478), three.js 3D-preview migration (multi-file glTF fixed, arm64 3D previews) (#496 steps 1–2, #486), shared browse view controls (#511), CI-reliability epic (#485); fixes a federation-path query bug caught by the nightly (#538) |
| **v0.5.2** | 2026-07-21 | `content.read.all` capability (#474) — a content-plane-only read cap so a read-only viewer (the public demo) sees `team`/`restricted` content without exposing admin surfaces; fixes the demo's blank "Preview unavailable" tiles |
| **v0.5.1** | 2026-07-21 | Shareable asset pages (`/assets/[id]`, fixing dead-end collection clicks) + 3D previews restored to published images (Blender was missing from the release build); also promoted the accumulated foundation work — scheduled-action engine (ADR 0020), audit retention/export (ADR 0032), and a visibility-consolidation batch |
| **v0.5.0** | 2026-07-20 | Public mode — anonymous browsing behind an operator toggle (off by default); single visibility enforcement point (ADR 0063); sensitivity gates content not rows (ADR 0064); featured rail on the placement model (ADR 0065); audit-IP PII gating |
| **v0.4.0** | 2026-07-18 | Operator visibility — jobs admin (queue / workers / failed / concurrency), storage usage + variant inventory, and integrity sweeps (orphan scan + checksum verify) as batched job kinds |
| **v0.3.1** | 2026-07-17 | Admin UI for read-only capability holders; repo-wide `gofmt` gate; `make release` |
| **v0.3.0** | 2026-07-17 | Media derivatives on seed/upload; read-only admin via `*.read` caps; responsive + WCAG-2.2-AA surface (390px → 4k) |
| **v0.2.0** | 2026-07-16 | Admin tile unlock (Tier 1–3); public read-only demo; native `aa seed`; CI across three runners |
| **v0.1.1** | 2026-07-13 | Worker-pool claim fix restoring media processing; dependency cleanup |
| **v0.1.0** | 2026-07-11 | First public tag — AGPL-3.0-only + commercial dual licensing, org move, single baseline migration (ADR 0057), Docker-only distribution |

> Pre-1.0 means schemas can still break across minor versions.

### Foundational capabilities

- **Single binary deploy.** Go server with the SvelteKit SPA
  embedded via `go:embed`. Multi-arch Docker images (amd64 + arm64),
  every image Sigstore-signed. Docker is the sole distribution
  channel until v1.0.0 — native packages (`.deb` / `.rpm`, static
  binaries, Homebrew) are a v1.0.0 target.
- **Postgres + storage.** Goose migrations run on boot. Storage
  backend is filesystem by default, or any S3-compatible bucket
  (AWS, R2, B2, MinIO).
- **Identity & auth.** Sessions, API tokens with scopes, roles &
  capabilities, password policy + SSO provider config UI (real
  enforcement of LDAP / SAML / OAuth lands with phase 1.18).
- **Upload pipeline.** Drag-anywhere → modal queue → background
  uploads with progress, per-row tags + per-asset metadata, three
  post-composition modes (one post / one-per-file / no-post),
  separate-cover-thumbnail support.
- **Posts + assets + collections.** Posts wrap one or many assets;
  collections wrap posts; tags + full-text search across all of it.
- **Admin-extensible metadata** (Phase 1.9). Operators define their
  own custom fields per asset_type (Phase 1.9.A — shipped with the
  baseline) and per collection (Phase 1.9.B — shipped 2026-06-20 via
  PR #144). Typed field vocabulary (text / longtext / rich_text /
  number / boolean / date / datetime / select / multi_select / tree /
  reference), per-field read/write capability gates, audit history,
  federation-ready provenance. ADR 0012. The subject-kind
  discriminator means future "things with metadata" (posts, users)
  reuse the same field_definition pipeline.
- **Browse feed.** Grid / masonry / thumbnail / list views with
  the sortable spreadsheet for list mode (toggleable columns,
  per-row thumbnails). Floating footer with view + feed filter
  (team / trending / latest / following) + sort direction.
- **Post detail modal.** Two-pane shell, multi-asset vertical
  scroller, sidebar with per-asset metadata, comments thread,
  likes, dedicated review canvas with zoom / pan / tile.
- **Admin shell.** 13-section admin menu with dynamic landing
  pages, capability-gated; real config surfaces for site, SMTP,
  auth providers, AI providers, appearance (font slot picker —
  14 fonts across 4 slots). An **admin-tile-unlock arc** (Tier 1–2,
  2026-07) made the surface fully navigable: audit-log viewer,
  per-user sessions + capability-grants, resource requests, trash
  (soft-delete restore), system log, and an API explorer served
  from the Go binary (`/api/v1/openapi.json`). Tier 3 (search/help
  flip tiles + the remaining stubs) is in flight.
- **Account shell.** Profile, theme + language preferences, API
  tokens management, active-session management. Remaining surfaces
  (drafts, activity, stats) stubbed with phase tags.
- **Public demo.** A read-only demo instance (`demo.artist-alley.org`)
  runs the release image behind a write-blocking nginx edge, seeded
  from the Layer-A dataset, `demo`/`demo` sign-in, env-gated demo
  mode (`AA_DEMO_MODE`). Auto-redeploys on each release.
- **Theme system.** M3-shaped color tokens (3-tier surface ladder,
  semantic success/warning/danger, on-* pairs, focus ring), light
  + dark palettes with intentional cross-mode hue shift, admin-
  configurable font slots (brand / display / sans / mono).
- **i18n.** Per-user language preference, locale catalogue endpoint,
  hand-rolled flat-key dictionary store; English shipped, Spanish +
  French stubs for the picker.
- **Universal asset viewer** (Phase 1.18.B-2 + 1.18.E-6). A single
  Svelte shell hosts per-kind view bodies (image, video, audio, PDF,
  font, 3D) with a shared anchor model — a frame number for video,
  a page for PDF, a camera + time-on-track for 3D — so future
  annotation overlays and presentation rooms wire to the shell once
  and every kind inherits them. Universal pan + zoom (⌘-wheel zoom-
  toward-cursor), click-to-pause, fullscreen + `F`, jump-to-frame
  (`G`), and per-kind transport bars all sit on the shell.
- **Format coverage** (Phase 1.18.A / 1.18.B-1 / 1.18.B-10–12 /
  1.18.C / 1.18.D / 1.18.E). Images: PNG, JPEG, WebP, plus HDR /
  EXR / Radiance `.pic` via ffmpeg tonemap (1.18.E-4) and a pure-Go
  RGBE decoder (1.18.E-5). Video: HLS adaptive ladder with frame-
  accurate scrubbing. Audio: waveform PNG + click-to-seek scrub.
  PDF: multi-page navigator + raster. Fonts: specimen render. 3D:
  native viewers for glTF / GLB / OBJ / FBX / Marmoset `.mview`,
  server-rendered turntable thumbnails via a headless three.js worker
  (Chromium/SwiftShader — the same loaders as the viewer, so thumbnail
  and live view match; #498/#500), pure-Go importers for legacy game
  formats (MD2 / MD3 / MDL / MS3D — 1.18.C-2 / C-3). Asset companion
  files (textures, `.mtl`, `.bin`) resolved per-asset so 3D loaders
  can pull their sidecars.
- **Federation v1 — walled-garden protocol** (Phase 1.22.D). The
  reference implementation of [**ArchivePub**](/protocol/archivepub/),
  the open federation protocol for DAM-shaped content built on the
  ActivityPub data model. Per-actor HTTP inbox + outbox with HTTP-Sig
  + Ed25519 envelope verify; share-list access control; outbox
  dispatcher with LISTEN/NOTIFY; HTTP/2 delivery worker with batched
  per-peer POST + signing + exponential backoff; recipient resolver
  against `federation_shares`; admin queue UI with re-queue +
  cascade-cancel + audit. Sub-1s p99 end-to-end against production
  defaults. First federated DAM, open-source or commercial. See
  ADR 0043. **Encrypted federation arc 1.22.I-a through 1.22.I-i
  COMPLETE + dogfood-validated end-to-end 2026-06-15** via
  ui-nightly 27558910639: all 8 conformance vectors (scenarios
  01, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 11, 12) PASS in 34.8s wall.
  Shipment trail: I-a dogfood infra (#109 + #110), I-b keypair
  (#111), I-c key distribution (#112), I-d capability
  negotiation (#113), I-e outbox encryption (#114), I-f inbox
  decryption (#115), I-g sender refusal flip (#116), I-h
  rotation lifecycle + admin UI (#126 + #127 + #129), I-i
  receiver-gate activation + scenario 05 + spec v1.0-rc1 (#128 +
  #130). Plus eight follow-up PRs (#117–#125) closing real
  production-class bugs surfaced by the dogfood loop — every
  gap caught by the loop, none by unit tests alone.
  **ArchivePub spec at v1.0 (final)** — Appendix A conformance
  test vectors locked at rc1; the 7-day soak window closed
  2026-06-22 clean and v1.0-final was stamped 2026-07-13 as a
  spec-only change.
#### v0.1.0 release readiness (Phase 1.55)

The meta-arc that took the project from current-`dev` to the v0.1.0 tag — the
first-ever tagged release. Seventeen sub-phases, 2026-07-07 → 2026-07-11.

| Sub-phase | Date | What it did |
|---|---|---|
| **1.55.A** | 07-07 | Master release-readiness audit (`docs/v0_1_readiness.md`) — exit criteria, gap inventory, sequencing |
| **1.55.B** | 07-08 | Hygiene bundle — oapi-codegen pinned, MDX hazard gate, schema-freshness boot detection, baseline verification |
| **1.55.R** | 07-08 | v0.1.0 milestone rename pass — recalibrated "v1.0.0" language to "v0.1.0" |
| **1.55.S** | 07-08 | Upstream sanitization + physical reference-tree deletion |
| **1.55.T** | 07-09 | Release-candidate dry runs |
| **1.55.T-2** | 07-09 | Docker-only distribution + all-green rc9 dry-run |
| **1.55.U-1** | 07-08 | Schema + cache audit report (0 MUST / 23 SHOULD / 11 NICE) |
| **1.55.U-2** | 07-09 | Gold-standard baseline re-squash — 29 migrations collapsed to one |
| **1.55.U-3** | 07-10 | Folded `00002_digest_queue` into the baseline |
| **1.55.V-1** | 07-09 | i18n coverage audit |
| **1.55.V-2** | 07-09 | i18n MUST-tier fixes + locale-switch test |
| **1.55.W** | 07-09 | Reverse-image dropzone at `/search/advanced` |
| **1.55.X** | 07-09 | @-mention notifications wired to notify |
| **1.55.Y** | 07-10 | Email digest preferences + one-click unsubscribe |
| **1.55.Z** | 07-11 | Removed `site/` from the OSS repo, rewired CI (site split) |
| **1.55.AA** | 07-11 | Executed the AGPL + commercial relicense |

**Full phase-close log** — PR numbers, squash SHAs, gate checklists, audit findings:


The meta-arc getting
from current-dev to the v0.1.0 tag — the first-ever tagged release
(see [docs/v0_1_readiness.md §0](./v0_1_readiness.md) for the
milestone model that separates v0.1.0 = first tag from v1.0.0 =
out of beta). 1.55.A shipped 2026-07-07 via PR #220 (squash
`9d14fc30`, closes #219): `docs/v0_1_readiness.md` is the master
audit — 9,907 words / 1,692 lines / 9 sections covering v0.1.0
exit criteria (7 ADR-anchored), arc-close velocity (25 PRs
2026-06-22 → 2026-07-07), 22 open gaps with mandatory substructure
(Status / Roadmap phase / RS blueprint capture / 2024-2026
gold-standard research citations / Caching strategy / Federation
implications / Target sketch / Effort / Sequencing), post-v0.1.0
deferrals, RS reference inventory with delete-safety verdict YES
on every row, sequencing proposal (base v0.1.0 scope ~9 days;
full menu ~17-22 days), 7-gate RS deletion readiness checklist,
post-milestone arc pointers (split v0.1.0 vs v1.0.0). **Unblocks two follow-up arcs:**
(a) physical deletion of the ~102 MB gitignored `/dbstruct/` +
`/include/` + `/plugins/` + `/pages/` upstream reference tree
(§6 confirms every pattern is captured internally); (b) the
AGPL + commercial relicense arc per ADR 0016 → 0017 direction,
gated on this audit + Phase 1.24. **Recommended next sub-phase**
per §7.1: **1.55.B hygiene bundle** (~1.5 days) — bundle #218
oapi-codegen version pin + #214 MDX braced-identifier CI gate +
§4.4 schema-mismatch boot detection + §4.21 baseline migration
squash verification into one PR. All sub-day, all pure release-
readiness hygiene.
**1.55.B shipped 2026-07-08** — release-readiness hygiene bundle
(§7.1 complete). Four sub-day items in one PR: oapi-codegen pinned
to v2.7.2 in scripts/generate.sh (no more silent @latest drift
breaking Codegen check); MDX braced-identifier hazard gate at
scripts/check-mdx-hazards.sh + a workflow that scans changed
synced-to-Astro docs on every PR (0 hazards on current dev tip;
no grandfather list needed); db.CheckSchemaFreshness wired
post-Migrate in app/cmd/aa/main.go — refuses to start on
SchemaUnappliedMigrations, warns on SchemaUnknownNewerSchema,
proceeds silently on SchemaOK; scripts/verify-baseline.sh runs
three checks (baseline present + ADR 0046 referenced; baseline
applies clean on a fresh pgvector/pgvector:pg16 scratch DB via
the real db.Migrate + goose.UpContext path; migration filename
sequence contiguous) and the current run reports "baseline
verified against 28 append migrations, head=00029, ready for
tag." Deferred: unified /admin/system/health surface for
the schema-freshness warning — no such endpoint exists today
(only per-subsystem shims); boot WARN log is enough pre-v0.1.0
per pre-release-practices.
**1.55.R shipped 2026-07-08** — v0.1.0 milestone rename pass. Pure
docs recalibration after the user clarified two milestones:
v0.1.0 = first tagged release (RS deleted + base feature set);
v1.0.0 = out of beta (real usage + soak + stable production).
`docs/v1_readiness.md` renamed to `docs/v0_1_readiness.md` via
`git mv`; new §0 Milestone model section added at top of doc;
every "v1.0.0" that meant "the release we're building toward"
retagged to "v0.1.0"; §9 split into post-v0.1.0 + post-v1.0.0
subsections; ADR 0046 grows a pending-review note pointing at
issue #228 (whether append-only kicks in at v0.1.0 vs v1.0.0);
issues #228 + #229 filed to track the ADR 0046 + 0016/0017
semantic decisions separately. Zero substance change; naming
recalibration only. Closes #227.
**1.55.S shipped 2026-07-08** — RS sanitization + physical
reference-tree deletion (§1.2 exit criterion). Three obsolete
`scripts/rs-*` pullers deleted; RS mentions scrubbed from 9
code/config files (`userstate.go`, admin About page, Dockerfile,
`.goreleaser.yaml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`,
`.dockerignore`, `.gitignore` header, `README.md` untouched — zero
refs there); ADR 0001 flipped to `superseded-by: 0040`; the
`docs/v0_1_readiness.md` §1.2 exit criterion flipped to ✅ shipped
+ §6 preamble annotated "physically deleted 2026-07-08" + §8
checklist all seven gates cleared. ADR 0002 skipped for a
pending-review pointer (already `superseded_by: 0016` from prior
lifecycle; redundant). Local `/dbstruct/` `/include/` `/plugins/`
`/pages/` physically removed from disk; `.gitignore` entries
retained as safety net. a case-insensitive product-name pattern sweep
in application code + config now returns empty; deliberate
historical mentions retained in ADR bodies + `cleanup-audit-2026-06.md`
+ this readiness doc's §6 inventory + memory files. Closes #231.
**1.55.U-1 shipped 2026-07-08** — schema + cache audit report for
the v0.1.0 baseline re-squash. Report-only; zero code changes.
Ships `docs/schema_audit_v0_1.md` — a 10-section inventory of the
29-file migration chain, 78 tables, 30 named cache domains + 4
dedicated Cache types, FK cascade behaviour, and CHECK-constraint
density. Findings: **0 MUST / 23 SHOULD / 11 NICE** (deduplicated).
The SHOULD tier is dominated by 15 unindexed FK columns (partial
indexes with `WHERE <col> IS NOT NULL` predicates) plus 3 explicit
`NO ACTION` → `SET NULL` cascade promotions plus 4 cache-invalidator
verification gaps (asset PATCH → IIIF, collection POST/PATCH →
owner profile, per-user cache-key exhaustive sweep, ActorOutbox
federation-key shape). §10 sketches the 1.55.U-2 re-squash plan:
collapse 29 files into `00001_baseline_v0_1.sql` with SHOULD fixes
inlined; zero append migrations at v0.1.0 tag time. Q6 nullability
+ defaults sweep clean; Q7 EXPLAIN spot-checks healthy on the two
representative queries. `pg_stat` verified index churn zero across
the chain (no index name recreated more than once in any Up
block). Closes #233.
**1.55.U-2 shipped 2026-07-09** — gold-standard baseline
re-squash. Ships `app/internal/db/migrations/00001_baseline_v0_1.sql`
(5,631 lines): the collapse of the 29-file chain into a single
file per §10 of the audit doc. **All 23 SHOULD + 11 NICE findings
dispositioned per docs/schema_audit_v0_1.md §11.** Applied inline:
15 partial FK-covering indexes + 3 explicit `NO ACTION` → `SET NULL`
cascade promotions. Cache-invalidator fixes (§7.1–§7.4) shipped
as distinct commits: targeted IIIF invalidation on asset + collection
writes (replaces bulk `InvalidateAll` with `InvalidateAsset(id)`/
`InvalidateCollection(id)`); owner-profile invalidation on collection
Create/Delete/Restore (mirrors the posts-side pattern); per-user
cache-key exhaustive audit + ActorOutbox federation-key shape
audit-verified. `apiServer` grew `pool` + `cacheReg` fields for the
cross-domain invalidators. ADR 0057 (v0.1.0 baseline schema shape)
shipped + synced to Astro — documents ownership model, federation
posture, soft-delete pattern, indexing strategy, cache invalidation
model, and data seeds. Old 29 migration files deleted;
`scripts/verify-baseline.sh` updated for the new filename and green
against a scratch `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` container. Fresh boot on
the compose stack applies cleanly; goose records `version_id=1`;
seed data populates correctly (57 capabilities, 13 asset_types,
10 roles, 43 role_capabilities, 42 system_config, 7 workflow_states,
11 workflow_transitions, 13 field_definition, 1
`federation_dispatch_state` singleton — the last-mile fix in
commit `7a44d86c` that unblocked CI Integration tests). Full
`./scripts/test.sh` green. `app/schema.sql` unchanged; sqlc
regen produces byte-identical Go output. pg_dump `--schema-only`
diff pre-vs-post shows only the 18 intended changes (15 indexes +
3 cascade promotions) — zero unintended drift. Closes #235.
**1.55.W shipped 2026-07-09** — reverse-image dropzone at
`/search/advanced` (closes §4.16). Frontend for the visual-search
backend that's been feature-complete since #199 + #205 + #206 with no
UI to drive it. New `ReverseImageDropzone.svelte` mounts above the DSL
builder: drag+drop / file-picker + preview + submit + states. POSTs
multipart (`file` field) to the existing `POST /search/by-image` via
raw `fetch` (the endpoint isn't in openapi). The thin
`{asset_id, similarity}` response is hydrated top-30 via
`GET /assets/{id}` and rendered as an `AssetCard` thumbnail grid with
cosine-similarity badges (Milvus/Weaviate pattern). Results render
**inline** — the advanced page previously only redirected to `/search`,
so this is its first inline results surface. Disabled/not-configured
is attempt-and-handle (no client-readable `search.visual.enabled`
flag): a 501 `sidecar_not_installed` flips to an explanatory state;
413 / 429 / 503 / generic each surface a user-facing message. All
strings i18n-keyed under `search.by_image.*` (en-only per #247) +
added to the coverage-guard tracked list. **Zero backend / openapi /
migration changes.** Browser-verified end-to-end (render → select →
preview → submit → handled response); Playwright spec `ui-31` covers
render + interaction + handled-state (the standalone CI stack lacks
the CLIP sidecar, so by-image returns 501/404 → the spec asserts the
handled path per the audit's Q10). svelte-check 0 errors; i18n guard
green (49 tests). The reverse-image feature is now end-to-end complete
(backend 4 PRs + this frontend). Closes #251.
**1.55.X shipped 2026-07-09** — @-mention notifications wired to
notify (closes §4.5). New `app/internal/social/mention/` package:
`ParseMentions` extracts `@username` from post title+description +
comment bodies (charset `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,32}` matching the
registration pattern — hyphens are valid usernames) excluding code
fences / inline code / links (standard chat-app behaviour); `Resolver.ResolveLocal`
maps usernames → local refs via a 5-min cache (null-cached to shrug
off `@here`/`@channel`; usernames are API-immutable so no invalidator).
Both `posts.CreatePost` + `social.CreatePostComment` fire the hook
**after** the insert commits (best-effort — a notify failure never
rolls back the content), targeting the containing post so the bell
deep-links to `/posts/{id}`. Reuses the **pre-existing** `mention_of_me`
verb (already in `KnownEventTypes`) + `notifications.Writer`, which
already gates self-mentions (actor==recipient), blocks, and per-verb
prefs — **so self-mentions are de-duped by the substrate, no resolver
filter**. Parser returns `Mention{Username, InstanceHost}` — the
federation seam (`InstanceHost` always empty in v0.1.0; post-Phase-1.30
`@user@peer.com` is a resolver-side addition via WebFinger, not a
rewrite). Unknown usernames drop silently; no un-mention audit
(deliberate). **Frontend needed zero changes** — the bell already
renders `notifications.verb_mention_of_me` + deep-links post targets,
so this arc was backend-only. **Zero migrations** (verb + prefs
pre-existed). 18 tests: parse (code-fence/link/email exclusion,
hyphenated + case-insensitive usernames, length cap, federation-seam),
DB-backed resolve (known/unknown/federated/cache-hit), service fire,
and handler-level end-to-end (comment mention lands a notification row
with target=post + actor threaded; plain comment fires nothing;
self-mention doesn't notify self). Closes #253.
**1.55.AA shipped 2026-07-11** — execute the AGPL + commercial
relicense (closes #229). Flips the OSS repo from BSD-3 to
**AGPL-3.0-only** (dual-licensed with a separate commercial license)
per ADR 0016/0017 — before the v0.1.0 first-public-release, so the
first public commit ships under the intended long-term license. Root
`LICENSE` replaced with the verbatim canonical AGPL-3.0 text (diff vs
gnu.org = only the two "How to Apply" template lines: program name +
`Copyright (C) 2026 Kenneth Blossom`). New `LICENSING.md` documents the
dual model — AGPL-3.0-only for open-source use (§13 network copyleft),
or a paid commercial license for embedding/SaaS without the copyleft,
contact `licensing@artist-alley.org` (placeholder until the Cloudflare
portal lands). **SPDX one-liner headers** (`SPDX-License-Identifier:
AGPL-3.0-only` + `Copyright (C) 2026 Kenneth Blossom`) scripted onto
**876 non-generated source files** (638 `.go` + 170 `.svelte` + 67
`.ts` + the goose migration), correct comment syntax per language
(HTML comment for svelte). **Generated files deliberately NOT stamped**
— sqlc `*.gen.go`/`models.go`/`db.go`/`queries.sql`, `openapi.gen.go`,
`panicshim_gen.go`, `schema.d.ts`, and pg_dump `schema.sql` are
excluded so regen doesn't strip headers → zero codegen drift (verified;
a first pass wrongly stamped the sqlc-input `queries.sql` and leaked
the header into generated `.go` — caught + reverted). `web/package.json`
`license` → `AGPL-3.0-only`; README badge + license section updated to
the dual model; ADR 0016 gets an "executed" note. Attribution audit
was already clean (1.55.S: no RS-derived shipped code, single
copyright holder). `go build` + `svelte-check` + i18n guard green;
full Go suite green except the pre-existing env freshness test; zero
behavior change (headers are comments). SPDX identifier + copyright
line + commercial contact were user-confirmed before commit.
Closes #261.
**1.55.Z shipped 2026-07-11** — remove `site/` from the OSS repo +
rewire OSS CI (site-split OSS-side cleanup). The public docs +
marketing site now lives + serves from the private repo
`mscrnt/artist-alley-site` (www.artist-alley.org), pulling this repo's
docs from `dev` at build — so the OSS `site/` tree (48 files) + its
build/deploy workflows were dead weight. `git rm -r site/`; deleted
`docs.yml` (Astro build verification) + `site-github-snapshot.yml`
(GitHub-stats refresher that wrote into `site/`). **Kept
`mdx-hazard-check.yml`** — it guards the OSS doc SOURCE (braced-
identifier scan over `docs/adr/**` / `docs/install/**` /
`docs/roadmap.md`) that the private site still renders, so an OSS ADR
can't break the site build. Stripped the now-dead `site/**`
`paths-ignore` entries from `ci.yml` + `ui-pr.yml` (app CI untouched).
Added `site-rebuild-trigger.yml`: on push to `dev` touching
`docs/adr/**` / `docs/roadmap.md` / `docs/install/**` /
`app/api/openapi.yaml` / `app/schema.sql`, POSTs the Cloudflare Pages
deploy hook (`SITE_DEPLOY_HOOK` secret) so the private site rebuilds +
pulls the latest docs — secret-gated (no-op + logged if unset, never
fails CI), self-hosted runner (zero hosted minutes). Updated README's
project-structure tree + roadmap link (no more `site/` paths). `docs/`
source untouched — this removes the renderer, not the source. Clean
break, no shims. Closes #259.
**1.55.U-3 shipped 2026-07-10** — fold `00002_digest_queue` into the
v0.1.0 baseline (squash point #1 per ADR 0046). Inlined the single
post-baseline append (1.55.Y's `digest_queue` table + partial index +
FKs + `user_preferences.email_cadence` column) into
`00001_baseline_v0_1.sql` and deleted `00002` — the migrations dir is
single-file again, so **v0.1.0 ships with exactly one migration**.
DDL copied verbatim from `app/schema.sql` (the pg_dump parity target,
untouched). **pg_dump `--schema-only` parity: folded baseline ≡ (old
baseline + 00002) — schema-identical, zero drift.** `verify-baseline.sh`
green (`head=00001`, contiguous, 0 append migrations); sqlc regen
byte-identical (schema.sql unchanged); digest tests green against the
folded schema. After this the dir stays single-file until the next
feature appends `00002`, `00003`… through beta; the v1.0.0 fold is
squash point #2 (future repeat). Closes #257.
**1.55.Y shipped 2026-07-10** — email digest preferences + one-click
unsubscribe (closes §4.9). Per-topic email cadence (immediate /
hourly / daily / weekly / off) in a new
`user_preferences.email_cadence` JSONB column (additive; unset =
immediate so no existing user is surprised). The `notifications.Writer`
forks at its email-enqueue point: immediate → enqueue now; digest
cadences → insert a `digest_queue` row; off = "email" absent from
channels. **In-app notifications always fire independently** of email
cadence. One hour-ticking `digest.Coordinator` (cadence-gated by the
clock, mirroring the softdelete gc — cleaner than three job types)
batches each user's due rows into one `notification_digest` email,
marks them sent, self-re-enqueues. **RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe**:
every notification email (immediate + digest) carries
`List-Unsubscribe` + `List-Unsubscribe-Post: One-Click` with a
stateless HMAC-signed token (scramble key); `GET/POST
/api/v1/unsubscribe` verifies + drops the email channel (per-topic, or
`__all__` for the digest token) — no login, the token is the auth.
Three range-clamped sysconfig timing knobs (`digest` section). Prefs
(incl. cadence) ride the existing 5-min `userprefs.by_user` cache.
Frontend: per-topic cadence `<select>` on the preferences page +
i18n keys. **First post-baseline migration** (`00002_digest_queue.sql`)
— folds back into `00001_baseline_v0_1.sql` at the pre-tag re-squash
so **v0.1.0 ships zero append migrations** (per the owner directive +
ADR 0046). ~30 tests (signer round-trip/expiry/tamper, DueCadences,
coordinator batch/empty/idempotent, Writer fork immediate/digest/off,
UnsubscribeEmail per-topic + all, cadence validation) all green. Zero
changes to in-app delivery or the bell. Closes #255.
**1.55.T shipped 2026-07-09** — v0.1.0 release-pipeline dry-run.
Fired three `v0.0.99-rc*` tags against `.github/workflows/release.yml`
end-to-end to verify the signed-release matrix (goreleaser → binaries
/ .deb / .rpm / Homebrew; docker buildx → GHCR + Docker Hub multi-arch;
Sigstore keyless cosign signing) BEFORE cutting v0.1.0. Three real
defects caught:
(1) **rc1**: `npm ci` on the runner tripped npm/cli#4828 — rolldown
native binding missing → **fixed** in workflow with `npm ci` → clean
`npm install` fallback;
(2) **rc2**: goreleaser dirty-check tripped because `Stage bundle into
Go embed dir` step `rm -rf`'d the tracked nested `.gitignore` +
`npm ci` sporadically rewrites `package-lock.json` → **fixed** by
preserving tracked embed-dir files (`find … ! -name .gitignore
! -name .embed-placeholder -exec rm -rf`) + resetting lockfile churn
via `git checkout` post-build + printing `git status --short` as a
diagnostic;
(3) **rc3**: `.goreleaser.yaml` sets `CGO_ENABLED=0` but the `aa`
binary now depends on `mscrnt/webp` (cgo binding around `libwebp`) —
arm64 tarball cross-compile impossible without cgo cross-toolchain →
**NOT fixed**, escalated as **#238** (release-blocker) with 4 candidate
resolutions (Docker-only distribution / docker-in-goreleaser /
cgo cross-toolchain on runner / pure-Go webp fallback). Runner
parallel-fork-exec limits also surfaced as followup **#239**.
All three `v0.0.99-rc*` tags deleted; zero GitHub Releases/GHCR/
Docker Hub artifacts published (goreleaser failed before push on
all three runs). §1.6 of `docs/v0_1_readiness.md` flipped to 🟡 —
pipeline audit complete + fixes 1+2 landed, but #238 gates a green
rc4 dry-run. Closes #237.
**1.55.T-2 shipped 2026-07-09** — Docker-only distribution + all-green
rc9 dry-run + §1.6 close. Resolves #238 via **Option A** (planner
decision: drop binary/deb/rpm/brew from the v0.1.0 release matrix
since Docker is the documented channel and the Dockerfile already
handles cgo correctly per-arch). Six more `v0.0.99-rc*` tags fired
(rc4→rc9) — every RC surfaced a real defect the pipeline would have
hit at v0.1.0:
(4) **rc4**: goreleaser's metadata pipe unconditionally invokes `go`
(not skippable) → added `Set up Go` + `workdir=app` back to the
release-notes job;
(5) **rc5**: goreleaser synthesizes a default `builds:` when config
omits one → added `--skip=build,archive` — which then exposed that…
(6) **rc6**: `--skip=build` isn't a valid goreleaser v2 pipe (only
22 specific pipes are skippable; `build` is not among them) →
deleted `.goreleaser.yaml` entirely, replaced with `gh release
create --generate-notes` (fully automated on tag push, one fewer
dep, cleaner fit for Docker-only). Filed **#242** to track full
binary + package + Homebrew restoration as a **hard v1.0.0
prerequisite** so the debt is visible;
(7) **rc7**: docker job broke at Go build inside the Dockerfile —
`--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM` pins the go-build stage to amd64 for
speed, but only host `gcc` was installed; when TARGETARCH=arm64,
cgo shelled to host gcc which couldn't assemble arm64 mnemonics
from `mscrnt/webp`'s .S files → added `dpkg --add-architecture
arm64` + `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` + `libwebp-dev:arm64` +
per-TARGETARCH CC/PKG_CONFIG_PATH selection to the Dockerfile;
(8) **rc8**: build + push + Sigstore cosign sign all green
end-to-end; only the cosmetic Summary step failed on bash
interpolation of multi-line `${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}` into
a for-loop → switched to env-var passthrough + `while IFS= read -r`
line iteration; **cosign verify green** against
`mscrnt/artist-alley:0.0.99-rc8` (Sigstore transparency-log entry
confirmed offline);
(9) **rc9**: all 15 workflow steps green — release-notes ✓, docker
buildx multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) ✓, cosign sign ✓, Summary ✓.
Duration ~15 min. Verified cosign green against
`mscrnt/artist-alley:0.0.99-rc9`; Docker Hub manifest confirms
both arches + SBOM + provenance attestations.
All 6 rc tags + GH Releases deleted; GHCR + Docker Hub images from
rc8/rc9 stay published (cleanup requires `delete:packages` scope
not on the coding-agent's local token; noted as user-cleanup task).
§1.6 of `docs/v0_1_readiness.md` flipped ✅. Closes #238 + #241.
**1.55.V-1 shipped 2026-07-09** — i18n coverage audit for v0.1.0.
Report-only arc. Produces `docs/i18n_audit_v0_1.md` (10 sections):
system architecture + coverage-guard analysis + dictionary coverage
matrix (en 1608 keys / es 52 keys / fr 37 keys — **3.2% and 2.3%
coverage** vs the `completionPct: 5` claim in `locales.ts`) +
~275 route findings (~87 MUST / ~37 SHOULD / ~150 NICE) +
~340 shared-component findings (79 MUST / 141 SHOULD / 120 NICE) +
Playwright locale-switch coverage assessment (**zero specs switch
locale + assert translations**; MUST-tier gap for 1.55.V-2) +
backend user-facing-string audit (**214 unique English error
strings** across 699 hits in `app/internal/**` returned raw as
`openapi.*JSONResponse{Error: "..."}`; frontend `apiErr.error ??
t('…')` idiom short-circuits translation — flagged as **v1.0.0
prerequisite** parallel to #242 since the shape is a backend refactor
+ frontend mapper, not a straight-line V-2 fix) + fallback-behavior
documentation (3-tier: active locale → en → raw key; silent English
fallback masks the ~3% catalogue coverage with no runtime
observability) + coverage-guard extension plan (~10 actionable
items for 1.55.V-2 to execute against, including expanding
`TRACKED_FILES` from 24 → all MUST+SHOULD files, adding
attribute coverage for `label=` / `aria-labelledby` / template
literals, a locale-parity check with warn-only budget, dev-mode
observability instrumentation). Zero code changes; audit doc is the
durable artifact + 1.55.V-2 executes against §9 fix recommendations
and §10 guard extensions. Closes #244.
**1.55.V-2 shipped 2026-07-09** — i18n MUST-tier fix + locale-switch
test + guard extension. Executes the MUST scope from
`docs/i18n_audit_v0_1.md` §9. Extends `common.*` from 16 → 40 shared
keys (close/search/clear/load_more/download_original/untitled/saving/
relative-time dur_*/etc.) and adds **211 scoped keys** across
browse/setup/search/upload/comments/post_host/whiteboard/collections/
federation/viewer_playlist/auth/playlist — en.json 1608 → 1843 leaf
keys, **zero existing values changed**. 23 source files wrapped (20
`.svelte` + 3 `.svelte.ts` state files); **es.json/fr.json untouched**
— new keys are en-only and es/fr fall through to English per the owner
decision (#247 tracks actual translation). New Playwright spec
`ui-30-i18n-locale-switch` closes the audit's zero-test MUST gap:
asserts the navbar search placeholder flips en→es on switching to
Español + persists across reload via the `aa_lang` cookie (asserts on
the existing-Spanish `nav.search_placeholder` — proves the mechanism,
not es/fr coverage). Coverage guard extended per §10: `TRACKED_FILES`
24 → 44 (all now-clean MUST files; `AssetPlaylist` held back for its
deferred viewer-hotkey SHOULD strings), added `label=`/
`aria-description=` attribute coverage, strips HTML comments + `<code>`
+ `<style>` before scanning (kills 2 false positives), and a
**warn-only locale-parity check** reporting es 3% / fr 2% without
failing CI (orphan-key half stays blocking as a schema-drift guard).
`locales.ts` `completionPct` now **computed** from the bundled
catalogues (was a stale hardcoded 5). svelte-check 0 errors; 283
vitest tests green. SHOULD (~178) + NICE (~270) tiers deferred to
**#249**; backend error strings remain **#246** (v1.0.0 prereq); es/fr
translation remains **#247**. Audit §11 tracks every MUST finding to
disposition. Closes #248.
**1.55.C-1a shipped 2026-07-07** — soft-delete recovery foundation
(§4.6 partial). Migration 00029 adds `deleted_reason` to assets +
posts + collections and adds `deleted_at` to collections;
`app/internal/softdelete/` package ships the Restore + HardDeletePast
primitives per entity plus the nightly gc CoordinatorJob wired at
boot; `sysconfig.SoftDeleteConfig` exposes 4 retention knobs +
gc-hour-utc (range-validated); 10 new audit event constants +
Recorder methods; user hard-delete-by-gc anchors off the existing
`admin.users.archived` audit event rather than adding a competing
`deleted_at` column (hybrid scope per pre-audit). GC coordinator
reads sysconfig every tick so operator retention changes take effect
on the next nightly pass.
**1.55.C-1b shipped 2026-07-08** — soft-delete surface layer
(§4.6 complete). DELETE handlers on assets + posts + collections
accept an optional `SoftDeleteRequest` body carrying an operator
reason string (max 500 chars); collections DELETE flips from HARD
to SOFT delete on the same code path (clean break per pre-release
practices); 3 new admin restore endpoints at
`POST /admin/{entity}/{id}/restore` delegating to
`softdelete.Service` from the foundation with a CTE-based snapshot
of the pre-restore state so the audit event carries `prior_reason`
+ age-at-restore; `?include_deleted=true` admin-only query param
on the 3 list handlers (non-admin toggles ignored); `GetCollection`
grows a fallback branch that surfaces soft-deleted rows to admins
so the Restore button on `/collections/[id]` has something to
render; admin UI ships the include-deleted toggle on `/collections`
list + Restore action on collection detail; posts/assets admin
detail-page Restore UI deferred (no admin detail page exists;
assets viewer-based). Live smoke green end-to-end.

## Release roadmap

The near-term release train is an **admin-completion spine** — GitHub
milestones are the source of truth. The admin menu is 36 live / 64
future tiles across 13 sections; the future tiles cluster by area and
map to the milestones below.

> **⚠️ Release train re-cut 2026-07-27 — authoritative summary. The detailed per-version prose further down predates this and is being reconciled; where they disagree, this table + the GitHub milestones win.**
>
> **What changed on 2026-07-27 and why.** v0.7.0's theme was *"operator configurability + browse polish"* — two releases in one, which is why it kept growing instead of closing. It has been split: the browse half keeps v0.7.0, and **two new milestones were inserted**, shifting everything from the old v0.8.0 upward by two. No issues were reassigned in that shift; the milestones themselves were renamed, so each carried its contents with it.
>
> **Scope correction 2026-07-29.** v0.8.0 had drifted into a catch-all: of its 12 open issues, eight had been filed in the preceding 48 hours and assigned to it *because it was the current milestone*, not because they matched its theme. Six moved out — #706 → v0.9.0, #212 → v0.10.0, #687 → v0.19.0 (rejoining #242, which already tracks native binaries as a v1.0 prerequisite), and #683/#714/#725 → a new release-less **seed & demo data** milestone. Seed and demo-dataset work does not gate a tag and no longer inflates release scope. v0.8.0 is now six issues with one subject.
>
> | Milestone | Theme |
> |---|---|
> | **v0.6.0** ✅ | Public read surface + demo hardening *(shipped 2026-07-23)* |
> | **v0.7.0** ✅ | **Browse correctness + visibility security** — cards render correctly (aspect ratio, masonry stability, overlays, blur-up, preview ladder) and the visibility leaks found while doing it (epic #665) *(shipped 2026-07-28)* |
> | **v0.8.0** ✅ | **Operator & admin configuration** — the admin config spine (epic #519): editable vocabularies, hierarchy tree editor, open-vocabulary keywords, rich text, site-text + email-template overrides, and `fields.admin` as a grantable capability *(shipped 2026-08-03)* |
> | v0.9.0 | **User-facing surfaces** — preferences that take effect (#706, #736, #677 ✅), explicit shares that actually grant read (#667 ✅ via #874/#879), account-tile completeness (#600), asset edit route (#549), one visual result surface (#850), social feed card (#557), teams browse + channels (#684, #577). The sharing arc grew a **visibility spine** as it landed: membership never widens an item's visibility (#883 ✅), a federated collection share stops at the members its grantor owns (#893 ✅), and you may only collect what you can content-read (#882 gate ✅). The spine closed with **#881 ✅** (the placeholder now offers "Request access" — the owner is notified and can decide it themselves, which they could not before; the *unlock* half is #912), **#899 ✅** (an asset you cannot open no longer hands you its description, hash, size or metadata — on `GET /assets/{id}`, browse, search, suggest and facets) and **#873 ✅** (search, facets and autocomplete now compose the same rule browse does, so an `org-only` post — the default tier — is findable at last). Between them, one rule per plane: `visibility.FieldsReadable` decides which asset FIELDS ship, `visibility/post_rule.go` decides which posts appear, and both are the only expression of their rule. The spine then grew its first **reader-side** layer: **#891 ✅** built the machinery to subtract placeholders from a visibility-filtered feed — the first display preference to do so — and **#921 ✅** made it the **default** once it was measured, one seeded account's feed being 82 posts of which 27 were entirely placeholders. The feed now leaves them out; `show_restricted` puts them back. The line, recorded in amendments to **ADR 0064** *and* **ADR 0020**: a placeholder belongs where you asked a question or opened a container — so `GET /posts/{id}` and collection contents still render them, and #913's "Request access" survives. The invariant is unchanged and bounded (subtract only, compose with the single readability call, never reach the detail path); what moved is the default *presentation*, not the access *rule*. Alongside it the browse surface stopped over-answering: **#908 ✅** takes the curated Featured rail off filtered results, **#914 ✅** stops the new-collection dialog asking for a visibility the API already defaults, and **#918 ✅** fixes a post with no members failing to open at all — it re-fetched itself indefinitely behind a permanent skeleton — plus Share being offered to non-owners. The milestone then turned to **authorization correctness**, which is where it found real holes: **#916 ✅** (the ACL API accepted a username, returned 204 and wrote a grant nothing could ever match — role/team principals were inert the same way and are now refused), **#920 ✅** (soft-deleting an asset never invalidated the post cache, so a deleted asset kept being served with its full metadata until the app restarted), **#917 ✅** (two ACL list descriptions that contradicted their handlers — one of which #876 had already reasoned from), and ⭐ **#930 ✅**, the sharpest: `UpdateAsset`/`DeleteAsset` had **no ownership or capability gate at all**, so any authenticated user could edit or delete any asset while only a super-admin could restore. Closing it delivered the feature it implies — **team-scoped content management**, an art director managing their team's files via ADR 0010 Layer 5 (already built, never called) — and surfaced that `posts.admin`/`collections.admin` had **never been grantable**, having existed only as Go constants. Also **#905 ✅** (`ip-address` CVEs shipped in the runtime image while Dependabot watched four directories that did not include the one they were in) and **#925 ✅** (NUL bytes made a source file invisible to grep, which had already hidden one defect from a brief). The authorization pass closed with two more: **#933 ✅** — a *public* collection handed its guest list to any authenticated user, the gap #876 had already closed for posts — and **#922 ✅**, which stops you attaching to a post an asset you are not allowed to open. The second one is the more interesting of the pair, because the fix **consolidated** rather than copied: "you may reference an asset you can see *and* can read the bytes of" now lives in one place (`visibility.CanAttachAsset`), with posts and collections both calling it, which retired the copy #882 had left inside the collections package. That is epic #665's whole premise — one expression of a security rule — applied to a rule that had just started to fork. Left open behind it: **#941**, the post *cover* is still ungated, so a cover you cannot read fails on a database constraint instead of a clean refusal *(closed by #941 ✅ and its sibling column by #946 ✅ — the three-week gap between them is its own lesson: when a rule covers a column, enumerate its siblings)*. The milestone's back half became **the permissions arc concluded and then instrumented**: **#939 ✅** decided and shipped the three-plane split (a mutation capability confers the *field* plane — a team lead reads the title they are editing — never the picture or the bytes), **#938 ✅** made publication delegable one verb per transition with entry into `active` always requiring `assets.publish`, **#954 ✅/#953 ✅** put team assignment under one membership-gated rule on both posts and assets, **#958 ✅/#961 ✅** created the seeded **Auditor** role and emptied the unreachable-capability backlog (with `share.grant` excluded for being an escalation route, and a reachability test so a capability nobody can hold now fails CI), and **#956 ✅** turned a mystery nightly failure into a fix: a failed capability lookup no longer masquerades as "you have no rights", and the diagnostic pipeline that made it a four-pass investigation — artifact uploads that succeeded while uploading nothing, a drift-guard test that deferred to the check it existed to back up — now fails loudly (#957). User-facing surfaces landed alongside: the **asset edit page** (#549 ✅) with the card affordance that had only ever been a "coming soon" stub, the account language applying **at sign-in** (#869 ✅), the post cover thumbnail actually saving (#946 ✅), and dead theme tokens removed by byte-diffing the built CSS (#678 ✅). The arc closed with **#888 ✅**: a three-plane memory sampler (Go heap / cgroup / child processes) plus threshold-triggered heap profiles into a bounded ring — and on its first storm run it *named* the OOM culprit the milestone had been dying of (allocation churn in the image scaler, 9.5 GB of 13.4 GB of all allocation, plus a 1 GB cgo arena that never returns), turning #887 and #890 from mysteries into named fixes — and then **#887 ✅/#890 ✅** landed those fixes measured against the same yardstick: a byte-weighted scratch budget and job-scoped scaler reuse took the identical storm from 93.6% of the old ceiling (killed) to 78.8% (zero captures) at no throughput cost, `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2` returned a gigabyte glibc was hoarding, and tini as PID 1 took render zombies from 328-and-climbing to zero while a deliberately failed ffmpeg still reports exit 42. The ~90-minute OOM cycle's three causes are now all named: scaler churn *fixed*, glibc arenas *capped*, chromium child RSS *characterised and open* (#972). The closing stretch turned to the user-facing tail: the feed's sort toggle genuinely sorts (and pages correctly in both directions) (#868 ✅), a malformed upload answers a plain sentence instead of leaking a database constraint name — with the two sibling columns that leaked identically swept in the same pass (#966 ✅), the page announces its real language to assistive tech with a pre-paint script and a locale that no longer outlives logout (#967 ✅), every keystroke has exactly one owner across the viewer/playlist/whiteboard stack and the advertised-but-missing shortcuts now exist (#885 ✅), the intermittent seed crash will name its own cause next time it happens — container state, kernel oom counters and verdict log lines captured at the moment of failure (#886 ✅, instrumented) — and **teams got their front door**: a studio directory, per-studio pages that provably never widen visibility, and a followable channels rail (#684 ✅, #577 ✅). **#937 ✅** gave every account a trash page — your own deletions listed with their remaining recovery window and a working Restore, admin-removed items shown honestly as needing a request (#931's seam), and the three hand-copied restore predicates consolidated into one `auth.CanRestoreDeleted` so the page's flag structurally cannot disagree with the endpoint it fronts. Shipping it exposed that **no product surface can actually delete anything** — every delete button was a stub — filed as #981, and **#981 ✅** closed the loop: all three delete affordances are live behind one shared confirm dialog (reason asked only when deleting someone else's work, feeding #931's appeal seam), a first toast system carries **Undo**, and the trash page gained a `deleted_by_me` tab so the person holding the restore right can finally *find* the item — scoped to the caller's own past deletions by construction, disclosing nothing the delete itself did not. **#931 ✅** completed the moderation arc's user half: a **restoration appeal** (one endpoint over all three kinds; `resource_request` went properly polymorphic with `target_kind`/`target_id`), decided ONLY by the deleter or a super-admin via the same `CanRestoreDeleted` rule — a second marker capability keeps the two request types' deciders non-interchangeable (the owner of a moderated item must not approve their own appeal, and `share.grant` is sharing authority, not moderation authority) — and granting performs the restore while writing **zero** capability grants (mutation-tested). The trash page now also keeps #985's promise by showing `deleted_reason`. The tail then closed two more: **#987 ✅** put Delete on the asset's OWN page by moving the flow down into the shell both routes render — the placement is now recorded in an ADR 0067 amendment, because the reason it cannot live in the route (`Modal` portals relative to where it is *declared*, so a dialog on the 43-line page renders under the viewer's top layer — invisible, while passing any DOM assertion) is exactly the kind of constraint that gets undone; and **#600 ✅ (its v0.9.0 half)** shipped `/account/activity`, a caller-scoped read over `audit_events` whose wire schema simply *has no* actor, ip or user-agent field — whitelist by construction, with metadata withheld on `on_my_account` rows in SQL **and** in Go. #600's six genuinely-unbuilt tiles moved to v0.11.0; the snapshot-permanence question its metadata rule surfaced is **#990**. **#991 ✅** then closed the loop the delete arc had left open: the Undo notice was being carried off-screen inside a detached `<dialog>` — a dialog that is *removed* (which is what a navigation does) fires no `close` event, so the portal's re-home never ran. It only bit on in-app entry, where the close policy is `history.back()` and therefore cannot be awaited. The fix makes a portalled node's survival independent of *how* its host ends; the durable part is the test, which asserts the notice is **in the document** rather than in the store — store-level assertions are what let it ship twice. The tail then paid down the tooling debt those two sprints exposed: **#993 ✅** found that "Vite HMR doesn't work here" — folklore this project had worked around for months, and which had just cost two consecutive sprints a debugging cycle each — was a **misdiagnosis**. HMR was never broken; the *watcher* was deaf, because inotify events do not cross the 9p mount of the Windows drive the checkout lives on, so nothing invalidated the module graph and the dev server kept serving its first cached transform (which is why even a full reload showed stale code). Fixed with `usePolling`, interval chosen by measurement — notably **not** 1000ms, which aliases against 9p's 1-second mtime granularity and makes latency bimodal. The lesson recorded: a workaround that reliably works is the enemy of a diagnosis. **#997 ✅** then corrected the cost figure that fix had enshrined: measured on a fresh worktree it read ~18%, but a tree that has been built in once carries `web/build`, and polling it was the entire difference — 645 watched entries fresh, 1,184 after a build, **757** with it excluded, taking the operator's own stack from 43-46% to ~28%. Two findings outlived the patch: the `.svelte-kit` directories the issue proposed excluding were **never watched** (SvelteKit's plugin already ignores them), so the `$types` risk being routed around did not exist; and the percentage is **host-specific**, so the config comment now quotes the watched *count* as the portable number and labels every percentage with its tree. **#1001 ✅** then cleared the one dependency alert Dependabot's grouping structurally could not reach — a vulnerable `nanoid` nested under a *production* dep — and the fix was **not** the npm `overrides` entry the issue proposed: the declared range already permitted the patched version, so it was a stale lockfile resolution, proven by a sibling package with the identical range that had resolved correctly. Six lines, no pin to remember to remove. The sprint also surfaced that **any npm-10 write silently strips `libc` fields from the npm-11 lockfile** (30 phantom deletions), which had been misattributed to host installs when both host and container run npm 10 — #1004 ✅ pinned it at source — and the fix landed alongside **#1012 ✅**, which found that the ADR frontmatter gate built to catch exactly this class **had never once fired**: it triggered on `pull_request` only, while ADRs are pushed straight to `dev`, so it guarded a path nothing travels. That gap had already cost three outages of the downstream site build (ADR 0071, 0073, and 0086 the same day). Both now carry the lesson that a guard is only as good as the events it subscribes to; #1014 tracks the remaining half — the gate reports, it still does not block the dispatch. The fields arc then got its operator surface: **#854 ✅** replaced the expanding-row table with a route per field (`/admin/fields/[code]`), cutting the index from 9 columns to 5 and relocating the editor, extraction and default components by props alone. It also surfaced `mirrors_column` read-only — as a callout rather than a disabled input, since a disabled control implies the value is normally editable — and revealed that `display_order`, `display_group`, `applies_to` and `description` had **no admin surface at all**, making the Advanced section the first place they can be set. The 409 conflict flow survived the move on a consolidated `adopt()`, proven against the **persisted** value. The milestone then opened its last arc, **fields**: **#822 ✅** ended `title`/`description` existing twice — the column stays the storage and the field definition declares itself a **view** onto it (`mirrors_column`), with enforcement in the **database** rather than in Go: `format('%I')` accessors mean no Go code names those columns, and triggers reject any attempt to store a second copy, so an untaught path fails loudly instead of silently diverging. ⛔ Its unanticipated half was **authorisation**: making a field a view merges two permission planes that were not equivalent, and left alone it would have let **every signed-in account retitle every asset on the instance**. The write rule now has one home (`visibility.AssetMutationCaps.MayMutateOwned`), with the generalisable lesson recorded in ADR 0012 — *when one concept gains a second write path, the permissive gate wins by default, and that default is a security bug*. **#552 ✅** completed the arc: `show_on_card` lets an operator pick which fields appear at a glance, replacing a single hard-coded date line, with vocabulary slugs resolved to labels server-side so a tile reads "Pass 1" not `pass-1`. It ships as a **display hint** under ADR 0012's rule — verified by observing that an unconfigured install still renders correctly — and it carries the operator's federation constraint into the UI: remote work uses the same card and layout as local work, while `Asset.origin` attributes it by display name in **all three densities**, since attributing only the details tile would leave it unattributed in the default grid view. **#882 ✅** then closed in full: the asset half had shipped back in #898, so the remaining work was posts, and `GET`/`POST /collections/{id}/posts` plus a "Save to collection…" action completed it. Saving a post and saving all of its files are deliberately *different* actions on the same menu — one keeps the author's framing as a reference that dies with their post, the other lifts the images onto your own shelf — and the read rule got the epic #665 treatment on the way, `visibility.PostReadable` becoming the single expression that `posts` and `collections` both call. Its sharper finding was a **premise in the brief that the code refuted**: the `collection_posts` → `posts` FK cascade, assumed to handle deletion, never fires, because `DELETE /posts/{id}` is a *soft* delete and no row leaves `posts`. The membership survives and the reference disappears only via the listing's `deleted_at IS NULL` conjunct — which turns out to be the better behaviour (a restored post returns to the collections that saved it, where a hard cascade would have destroyed the association) and is now pinned by a test and recorded in an ADR 0009 amendment, along with the corollary that an absent-from-the-listing member is not an absent row. **#709 ✅** gave the operator the browse layouts themselves: a `system_config` key, an admin panel, and a public read — with an install that never configures it keeping all five, so an upgrade changes nothing. Being the OUTERMOST rung of #706's precedence chain was the whole difficulty, since the device's stored choice, the account default and the coarse-pointer guess can each name a layout the operator has since turned off; all three now run through **one** resolver whose terminal fallback is the first *enabled* layout rather than the shipped default — otherwise disabling `grid` would strand every user with no stored preference on the one layout the install refuses to render. The disabled choice is **preserved**, not overwritten, so re-enabling returns it. Its sharper lesson was mine: the brief specified an unconditionally anonymous read citing `/site-text`, and the agent corrected it to **public-mode governed** per ADR 0071 §3 — `/site-text` and `/appearance` are excused only because they render the login card, and a logged-out visitor browses only on a public install, which is exactly what that governance answers. `security: []` without registering the operation is a **build failure**, so the brief as written would have failed CI; 0071's amendment now generalises §3 into the default shape for any new anonymous read. **#1020 ✅** answered an owner request the same day it was made: the browse control bar returns when the pointer approaches the bottom, instead of only on a scroll-up — so reaching for a control no longer means scrolling away from what you were looking at. The mechanism already existed; what was new is the **trigger**, and where it had to live. `chromeScroll.hidden` is shared with the navbar, so the obvious call — the store's own `reveal()` — would have dragged the header down too; the reveal is instead a local term ANDed into the bar's own derivation, and the test asserts the shared signal is *still* set afterwards (mutation-tested, so it is known to bite). **ADR 0087** records the resulting rule: `reveal()` answers "the user did something that should bring the chrome back", a local term answers "this component in particular should not be hidden right now" — if the answer names one component, it is not a store call. Its second lesson was a defect my brief *specified*: `focus-within` for keyboard parity **pins the bar after any mouse click**, because a click focuses the control it lands on; `:focus-visible` is the real "arrived by keyboard" distinction, and only a browser run could have caught it. **#557 ✅ CLOSED THE MILESTONE**: feed view became a real social card — author header, media at its own aspect ratio, like/comment/share, `CardMenu` in the header — with `PostAuthor` riding the post payload so 72 cards render with **zero** `/users/` requests instead of one per author. Its lesson was the sharpest of the release and it was a **near-miss on PII**: the brief told the agent to reuse the display-name precedence *as documented*, but both the `UserPublic` schema description and the doc comment four lines above the code had omitted, since #478, that the `fullname` rung is skipped for anonymous callers per ADR 0064-adjacent ADR 0070 §3. Seeded users carry real names in `fullname` and no display name, so the brief as written would have put a real name on a public card. `users.ResolveDisplayName` is now the single expression; **ADR 0070** carries the correction and the general rule that a decision with a *security exception* must never be documented by summary. **ADR 0013** gained the two caching rules the sprint proved: caller-dependent identity is computed *after* the cache, never stored in it — otherwise the first authenticated reader warms the entry that the next anonymous reader is served — and a mutation must invalidate the domain that *serves* the value it changed, found via `social`'s like triggers moving `like_count` while only follow/block domains were invalidated (DB 4, API 3). Left open: **#1023**, the same opt-out unhonoured by `owner_display_name` on restricted placeholders |
> **Re-cut 2026-08-11 — milestones are now sized by STARTING scope, not by what a release ends up containing.** v0.10.0 had reached 63 open issues while the theme in its own title accounted for three of them; the rest had arrived because it was the next milestone, which is the same drift the v0.8.0 note below records. Measuring the last three releases turned a scheduling question into a sizing rule:
>
> | release | issues closed | existed at start | **filed during** | span |
> |---|---|---|---|---|
> | v0.7.0 | 67 | 0 | 67 (100%) | 6 days |
> | v0.8.0 | 67 | 2 | 65 (97%) | 6 days |
> | v0.9.0 | 74 | 18 | 56 (75%) | 8 days |
>
> **Between 75% and 100% of every release was discovered while it was being built**, so the ~70-issues-per-week figure is throughput, not capacity — planning to it would triple the length of a release. v0.9.0 is the only one with a meaningful starting scope, and it turned **18 planned issues into 74 closed in 8 days**: roughly a 4x multiplier, because each sprint files its own follow-ups. A one-week tag therefore *starts* with **15–20 issues**.
>
> Applied: v0.10.0 trimmed 63 → 17, and the five arcs it had absorbed moved to milestones that match them — the review-and-collaboration arc split across the two new milestones **v0.11.0** and **v0.12.0** (the player, then the shared canvas), **articles + 3D animation** paired as the new **v0.13.0**, teams/featured/social into Community, and workflow-state correctness into asset workflow. Everything from the old v0.11.0 onward shifted up by three. **The two halves of the review arc are deliberately adjacent**: #974's whiteboard shares the review player's canvas, so the seam is designed once.
>
> Two honest limits. The 4x multiplier rests on a single release, since the other two started from ~zero — re-measure after v0.10.0 rather than treating it as settled. And issue count is a crude proxy for effort; it is usable only because it held at 67/67/74 across three releases. Milestones beyond v0.15.0 are still mostly **epics** (42 of them), so their counts will grow when they are decomposed — read those rows as direction, not commitment.

> | **v0.9.0** ✅ | **User-facing surfaces + the permission spine** — one rule per plane (#939/#938/#954/#953), the missing ownership gate on asset update/delete closed (#930), reversible deletion with a trash page, Undo and an appeal path (#937/#981/#931), and the half-built surfaces finished: asset edit (#549), the social feed card (#557), collecting other people's posts (#882), teams + channels (#684/#577), a page per field (#854), operator-chosen browse layouts (#709) *(shipped 2026-08-11)* |
> | v0.10.0 ✅ SHIPPED 2026-08-16 | **⬜ SCOPE EXPANSION 2026-08-15, on the owner's ruling: "most of the stuff I am adding should go into v0.10.0 — they are all browse and search stuff."** The milestone became the **browse-experience release**: after the search/collections spine and the correctness tail landed (sprints 1–22 — the withholding arc #902/#1023/#1066, the featured-scope unification #1104/#1088, the search-match guard #1065, the masonry rework #747/#1025 and its two owner-found regressions #1095/#1103), the owner directed the browse surface's full design language in a single day and it ships here: the wide-card featured slider (#1110 ✅), the grid hover overlay with kind icons and identity (#1111 ✅ + #1126), the teams rail as an in-place feed filter with sticky pinning, curation panel and no-scrollbar drag (#1113 ✅, #1122 ✅), tag follows (#1123), bulk selection with marquee and shift-ranges (#1127), the per-density identity pass (#1047 — thumbnail/list/masonry/feed each get their own feel, informed by a live prior-art read of the mature DAM's configured-fields-per-density pattern), mature-content gating as a new rating axis over the ADR 0020 machinery (epic #1114: #1115–#1117), profile tabs hosted in the browse footer (#1106), the operator promo strip (#1118) and the featured-tab pin drop (#1121). Cadence note: sized at ~10 sprints on the owner's explicit call that the measured 6-sprints/day pace covers it — re-measure the sizing rule below against this release when it tags. |
> | v0.10.0 *(original cut, superseded above)* | **Search, collections & correctness tail** — the milestone trimmed to its own theme on 2026-08-11 (see the re-cut note below). Search *inside* a collection (#910), facets that actually filter (#907), and a restricted asset that still matches queries so its withheld title is recoverable (#902); plus the browse mismatch where the tile-size control resizes the post grid but not the featured rail (#909), and the correctness/chore tail worth clearing before a long arc — companion discovery at ingest (#754), growing vocabularies (#789), the blank epub cover (#856), per-test isolation (#870), per-asset unlock on an approved request (#912, `adr-needed`), unwatched Python tools (#928), the LICENSE placeholder GitHub reads as "no license" (#943), dead invalidators (#947), the unpinned npm version (#948), the unreachable admin gate (#962), five wrong migration citations (#964), the opt-out an asset owner still leaks (#1023) and the ui-13 search race that mails the owner on a coin flip (#1024). **⬜ RE-CUT AGAIN 2026-08-13, on the owner’s challenge — and the first cut had the problem backwards.** The 2026-08-11 trim kept a "correctness/chore tail" bucket, and **a milestone with a theme AND a chore bucket has no membership principle** — anything can be justified in. Worse, while off-theme chores sat inside, genuinely themed work was exiled to v0.11.0 as "carried beyond the tag". Corrected: **#754** (companion discovery at ingest) and **#856** (blank epub cover) moved OUT to v0.11.0 — both real, neither search- nor collections-shaped — and **#1056** (a facet filter narrows rows for a team-scoped `assets.admin` holder — the measured cost of #907, which shipped here), **#1059** (the `system.admin` bypass for collections lives outside the read rule in two hand-copied places — this milestone’s own #1023 failure mode) and **#1064** (suggest gates on the content plane — the #1066 family) moved IN. ⚠️ **The audit also found the real blind spot: 12 open issues had NO milestone, and every close-out pass reconciles milestones — so they were invisible to the process.** One of them, #1002, was a ZOMBIE: the same bug as #1040, fixed in sprint 1, still open only because nothing ever reviewed it. All 12 now have homes. Deliberately left OUT despite fitting the theme: **#1065** (nothing enforces `AssetSearchMatchSQL`) because its mechanism is undesigned — Postgres RLS is the wrong granularity for a model that keeps the row listed — and **an undesigned item does not belong in a closing milestone**; **#911** (smart collections) because it is a feature build, not a correctness tail; **#1074** (cover picker generality) because it is a deliberate follow-up. **Folded in on 2026-08-11 at the owner's call: the masonry column-span rework (#747) and the wide-aspect tiles it unlocks (#1025).** #747 was filed purely as infrastructure for the sized-slot epic (#745, ads/premium/curation), but it has **two** consumers — its own analysis measured **24 of 72 dev-feed tiles at 5.33:1 or 8.8:1**, so a third of the feed renders as a sliver until a wide image can take a second column. That is a browse-quality fix needing no monetization work, and leaving it behind the ads arc would have delayed it for no reason. The slot model itself (#746) and its fill sources (#748) stay with the monetization arc. ⚠️ #747 is by its own description "the load-bearing piece, and the risky one" — it carries five non-negotiables from #651 (append-stability, no measure-then-place, the `estimate()` chain, the a11y model, height bookkeeping), so this milestone is heavier than its 19-issue count suggests. **Sprint 1 ✅ (2026-08-12) — the CI foundation, because the milestone could not otherwise merge anything:** #1043 ✅ found the required check was being failed by a *cancelled* run rather than a failing one — the concurrency key named only the branch, so a push to `dev` and the `dev → main` promotion PR collapsed into one group and killed each other, and re-running the cancelled half (the obvious workaround, used twice on v0.9.1) rejoins the group and kills the survivor instead; the key now includes `base_ref`. #1040 ✅ made the browser UI check *skippable*: it needs the seed path, that path is a repository secret, and GitHub withholds secrets from Dependabot runs — so the job died on `invalid spec: empty section between colons`, naming neither the variable nor the secret. The gate had to become a real job, because the `secrets` context is unavailable in a job-level `if`. #948 ✅ pinned npm 11 (project + a CI container built to match) after four sprints of lockfile churn from npm 10 silently stripping `libc` fields — and corrected the record that the *image* pin landed in #1013, not #1004, with `ci.yml` carrying a stale comment claiming npm 10 was deliberate. #928 ✅ added the two `pip` entries and wrote down *why they keep no lockfile* — their images install from `pyproject.toml`, so a lockfile nothing consumes would only drift. **Then the four blocked Dependabot PRs cleared (2026-08-12):** #1034/#1035/#1037 auto-merged once green — with #1035 incidentally converging the render worker's `three` (0.169.0) onto the web app's (0.185.1), closing the sixteen-version skew #751 was filed for, though #751 stays open for the structural half (two manifests can drift apart again). #1036 (puppeteer major) held back for its own verification. ⛔ **And clearing them exposed #1049:** the 3D preview smoke gate — the only check that drives node → puppeteer → Chromium → render → PNG — runs on **no** pull request (`docker-build` is `if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'`, which #751 had already documented) *and* produces no push run after an automerge, because GitHub does not fire workflows for `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes. So all three landed with that gate having run nowhere; the renderer was verified by hand (smoke 10/10 at `217766f2`) and is fine. **Sprint 15 ✅ (2026-08-14) — a rule expressed in SIX places, and my acceptance criterion was UNBUILDABLE.** #1084 ✅ migration `00048` widens `featured_items_subject_kind_check` to admit `team`; new `GET /featured/teams` (`teams.read`); the rail leads with featured teams and pins "All teams" as a chip beside the scroller, resolving the stranded row #1030 deliberately left. ⭐⭐ **I briefed FOUR places the `subject_kind` constraint is written down; there were SIX.** The two I missed: the **RESPONSE** schema `FeaturedItem` carries its own enum separate from `FeaturedItemInput` (the server would have serialised `team` while the generated client narrowed it away), and `/admin/content/featured` used a **binary ternary** — so a featured team rendered as `COLLECTION`, blank title, `/collections/<team-id>` 404, **on the page an operator uses to REMOVE it**. ⭐ **The agent found both by featuring a team through the real endpoint and LOOKING** — no test would have surfaced either. ⛔⛔ **And my headline acceptance ("a featured PRIVATE team must not surface") was UNBUILDABLE: there is no such thing as a private team.** No `visibility.EntityTeam`, no visibility column on `teams` — per-viewer team visibility is **#978's** job. I briefed against a model I assumed rather than checked; the agent substituted the constructible test (soft-delete drops out + the capability gate) and left a comment marking where a real predicate lands when #978 ships. ⭐ **Down REFUSES, structurally and correctly:** `ADD CONSTRAINT CHECK` validates existing rows, so a surviving `team` placement raises 23514 and goose's transaction rolls the whole Down back — **no operator curation deleted to satisfy bookkeeping**. Composed rather than invented: `system.admin` still gates featuring (no new capability), and the featured path goes through `TeamHeroes` so #982's render-time re-check comes along. Side finding filed as **#1088**: `AddInput` has no `Scope` field, so every write lands `scope='org'` and **`public`/`team` scopes are unreachable from the API** — the same shape as #1080. **Sprint 14 ✅ (2026-08-14) — ADR 0088 gets its first consumer, and the consumer NARROWS it.** #982 ✅ (hero half; the featured slot + header chip split to **#1084**, which needs a `featured_items.subject_kind` constraint migration the issue had not accounted for). Migration `00047` adds `teams.hero_asset_id` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`; `avatar_asset_id` deliberately skipped — one pointer, one surface, until a second consumer needs a different crop. ⭐ **THE NARROWING: in a NAVIGATION STRIP the gate is not per-viewer, it is public-only.** A rail showing some teams' pictures and not others depending on who is looking is noise, not security. The test for which form applies: **does the surface let a viewer ACT on the difference?** An asset page can show a placeholder because #881 gives that caller a request-access route; a nav strip addresses nobody in particular. ⭐ **Deliberate asymmetry:** selection checks public + owned + not-deleted; render adds storage + `col` rendition, because renditions are ASYNC and refusing a just-uploaded asset is an error the admin cannot act on. ⭐ **And the stored pointer SURVIVES a hero being withdrawn** — restoring the asset's sensitivity brings the picture back with no admin action; a withdrawn hero is a suppressed answer, not a deleted choice. ⭐⭐ **The agent found a trap the brief did not name: `fetchTeam` reads through a by-id LRU that NOTHING about an asset's sensitivity can invalidate** — the team row does not change when the asset does. Mapping the hero in the row converter would have passed a naive flip test and then served a withdrawn picture for the life of the cache entry. **This is ADR 0013's rule arriving through CROSS-ENTITY INVALIDATION rather than caller-dependence** — a second, distinct reason to compute after the cache, now recorded in the 0088 amendment along with a cached-path twin of the flip test. ⛔ **My brief was wrong about goose markers:** I said `00047` needs `StatementBegin`/`StatementEnd`; **`00046` says the opposite in a comment** — those exist to stop goose splitting a body with internal semicolons, and wrapping plain DDL fuses three statements into one exec. **I carried a remedy without re-checking its reason**, the same failure as #902's "split by index". Verified by me live: flip to `restricted` → Animation reverts to initials while Characters keeps its picture; pointer retained; restore → picture returns. Follow-up filed: no admin UI to pick a hero (API-only today). **Sprint 13 ✅ (2026-08-14) — the browse rail batch, and FIVE brief premises wrong.** #909 ✅ `FeaturedRail` now takes `browseView.tileMin` as its tile width (verified by me: one click of Larger cards moved the rail **349→444px** and the grid **364→457px** together). ⭐ **The agent answered the open design question well: a rail is not a grid, so `auto-fill` has nothing to say — the width is CHOSEN, not derived from a column count**, and the ~14px residual IS the grid's `remainder/n`, widest at 390px where n=1. The three-zone clamp turns out **load-bearing rather than inherited**: a bare rung is 352px, which at 390px is one tile filling the viewport with no hint the row scrolls. ⭐ **Scope the agent added, correctly: the rail's `<img>` had NO `srcset`**, so shipping `sizes` alone would have been inert, and letting a tile reach 38rem while pinned to the 320px `col` crop would have fixed "two card sizes" by shipping "two card qualities". Now gated on `ladder_available` exactly as `CardThumb` is, rungs from `GET /previews` (#610's trap avoided). #1029 ✅ full rename incl. the store (`teamFollows`, named for one reader's follows rather than all teams) — **and the notification `channel_*` keys survived byte-identical**, which was the trap. #1030 ✅ both rails lose their `<h2>`; ⭐ **the heading was the section's ACCESSIBLE NAME via `aria-labelledby`**, so it went visually and `aria-label` took over — verified by me in the live a11y tree (0 `h2`, `region "Featured"` / `region "Your teams"`, no dangling `labelledby`). ⛔ **FIVE of my premises were wrong**, the worst being that I called the `channels.*` namespace 4 keys with one consumer when it is **25 keys across 4 consumers** — which made my acceptance criterion ("the ONLY difference is the rail keys") **UNSATISFIABLE**, since leaving 21 keys under the borrowed name preserves the very mismatch #1029 exists to fix. Also wrong: `TILE_STEPS_REM`/`DEFAULT_TILE_IDX` are module-private not exported; "no Go changes expected" was wrong because `app/internal/sitetext/catalogue.json` is a GENERATED byte-for-byte copy of `en.json` that CI's drift check requires; and #1029's own verify step pointed at the wrong page. Follow-up **#1083** filed (backend prose + OpenAPI descriptions still say "channels"; deferred because the descriptions ride the base64 blob and need a `generate.sh` gate). #1030 item 3 (a stateful grid heading naming the selected team) left undone — it needs the selection **#982** builds. **Sprint 12 ✅ (2026-08-14) — one home for the collection read bypass, and a TTL that can finally be cleared.** #1059 ✅ shipped `visibility.CanReadCollection`, a **named composite** of `Filter(EntityCollection)` + the admin plane, with both call sites switched to it and the primitive left **untouched** — option 2 over option 1 because adding the disjunct to `Filter` changes what it answers for *every* caller, including surfaces that legitimately want the admin-blind rule (an audit view, a "what would a normal user see" preview). ⭐ **The composite documents what it ASSUMES** — the disjunct is safe only where the caller has already established the admin plane — and names the **three neighbouring `system.admin` checks that are deliberately NOT this rule** (`handler.go:389`/`:750` soft-delete visibility, `canMutateCollection` at `:1484`). Absorbing those would have been **a widening dressed as a cleanup**, which is the specific failure the brief was written to prevent. #1073 ✅ moved `expires_at` to the `clear_cover` CASE shape; `ClearCollectionExpiresAt` (zero callers) **deleted** rather than wired, so there is one mechanism; the false comment claiming it was wired — the fifth such comment this milestone — corrected. ⛔ **MY BRIEF WAS WRONG THREE TIMES and the agent caught all three:** (a) I said the openapi promises *"become true"* once the clear path works — **they become MORE wrong**, because `omitempty` erases the absent/null distinction before the handler sees it, so `expires_at: null` cannot ever clear; the spec now documents the flag honestly and a test pins the shipped contract; (b) "keep the `pgx.ErrNoRows` handling" does not transfer — that guarded a *second* query in `CanAttachAsset` and there is none here; (c) "copy `CanAttachAsset` exactly" — its **shape** transfers, its **logic** does not, since that is a conjunction of two planes and this is a disjunction of a plane and a capability. ⭐ **Unrelated finding worth more than either fix: `collections.expires_at` is enforced by NOTHING** — no query, job or reaper reads it, though a partial index was built for one. Every `expires_at > NOW()` in the package is on *membership pins* (`collection_acls`, `collection_resources`), not the collection's own TTL. So #1073 repaired a genuinely broken contract over a **decorative** value. Filed as **#1080** (build the reaper or drop the field — ⭐ do not default to building it because the index exists) and **#1081** (`purpose` has the same defect, lower severity because `""` writes through, so only true NULL is unreachable). Both → v0.11.0. Verified by me on a rebuilt branch stack against a foreign private collection: admin gets **200/200/200** across `GetCollection`, scoped search and scoped facets — the divergence is gone. **Sprint 11 ✅ (2026-08-13) — one seam, three issues, and a LEAK found by grounding the brief.** #1075 ✅ **filed during verification, not before it**: `suggest.tags()` had NO visibility gate at all — its doc comment claimed *"the JOIN restricts to posts the caller can see"* while the JOIN required only that the post EXIST. Tag autocomplete drew from every post on the instance; prefix-walking recovered tag strings from invisible content — the #902 shape. ⭐ **Sixth time this milestone a comment asserted a guarantee the code did not provide**, and the one that best explains why they survive: it was wrong in the REASSURING direction, so a reviewer checking "is this gated?" found a sentence saying yes. #1064 ✅ moved suggest's asset titles to `FieldsReadableSQL` — the plane question was **forced, not preferred**, since the issue's own acceptance demands suggest and search agree and search has been field-plane since #902. #1056 ✅ put `MutationCaps` on `facet.Request` and moved the aggregators and the Engine together. ⛔ **Two of #1056's three stated requirements were already satisfied** — it was filed in sprint 3, before #902 shipped `FieldsReadableSQL`, and the facet cache it warned about does not exist. ⭐ **A FOURTH clause existed that neither the issue nor my brief named**: two Engine conjuncts, `query.go:605` (BM25) and `query.go:399` (the hybrid projection), the latter deferring to the former — left narrow, a cap-holder's filtered hybrid hits would have been dropped while the rail counted them. ⭐⭐ **THE FINDING WORTH MORE THAN THE FIX: when BOTH the aggregator and the Engine are consistently wrong, #907's count-equality assertion PASSES.** Agreement is all it can see. Only the subset check — *filtered ⊆ unfiltered, every entitled row survives* — catches it, because "entitled" comes from outside both clauses. **That generalises to every `*_MatchesGo` twin test in the repo: they are consistency checks, and none can tell you the shared rule is wrong.** ⛔ **My brief was wrong twice more:** it claimed five suggest sources including owner display names (there are **four**, and no owner-name source exists) — traced to **ADR 0056 §"Suggestion corpus", now amended**, which describes the INTENDED corpus and which I relayed as code state; and it sent the agent to a cap-holder test arm in `hit_withholding_test.go` that does not exist. Follow-ups **#1077** (the tag rail counts `asset_tag` + `post_tags`; suggest completes only `post_tags`) and **#1078** (collections suggest has no capability short-circuit — sequence it AFTER #1059, which is about to give that bypass one home) filed to v0.11.0. **Sprint 10 ✅ (2026-08-13) — the cover a curator CHOOSES, and a new reusable rule.** #1027 ✅ added `collections.cover_asset_id` (migration `00046`) — a pointer at **any asset the curator may picture**, gated per-viewer by the same picture plane #1026 uses, falling back to the derived mosaic when unset OR unreadable. ⭐ **Recorded as ADR 0088: a representative image is a POINTER, not a bespoke upload.** The natural precedent — `POST /admin/system/appearance/logo` — argues *against* itself: it had to build content-type-by-decoding, raster-only/SVG-refused, a 2 MiB + 16-1024px bound, a content-addressed pin and a 5-deep MRU history **because an instance logo has no asset to point at**. A cover does. And the deciding argument is ONE REPRESENTATION, not cost: a bespoke upload makes a cover sometimes an asset id and sometimes a storage hash, so every client branches — the ADR 0063 defect one level up, which this milestone has now paid for three times (#902, #1023, #1026). "Upload a banner" still works: upload it as an asset, then point at it. ⛔ **MY BRIEF WAS WRONG AND THE AGENT CAUGHT IT: I said to copy `CollectionUpdate`'s nullable-clears shape — that shape CANNOT CLEAR.** `expires_at` COALESCEs unconditionally, `ClearCollectionExpiresAt` has **zero callers** (its only mention outside generated code is a *comment* claiming it is wired — the fifth "a comment is not a call site" of this milestone), and `openapi.yaml` promises clearing in two places. Following the brief literally would have shipped a cover that could never be removed. Used the repo's litigated `clear_default` precedent instead; **filed the live bug as #1073**. ⛔ **And a review error of MINE: I reported the disabled "Set cover — coming soon" menu stub as ADDED by this PR. It was pre-existing** — I grepped the rendered string `"Set cover"` in an i18n'd component that only ever contains the key `set_cover`, so the miss was not evidence. The substance stood (it shipped live rather than left contradicting the release), but the provenance was wrong. Also fixed: `list_page.go` hand-mirrors the SELECT list and scans **positionally**, silently dropping the new column on browse — caught by an assertion, not by reading. Verified by me in the browser end to end, including the clear path **asserted at the database** (`cover_asset_id` back to 0 rows). Follow-up **#1074** (the picker offers members; the API accepts any picturable asset) filed to v0.11.0. **Sprint 9 ✅ (2026-08-13) — a security bump whose real work was proving the RENDERER survived it.** #1070 ✅: Dependabot flagged `extract-zip` (high, symlink path traversal) with **`first_patched_version: null`** — ⭐ **which does not mean unfixable, it means not fixable by bumping THAT package.** The remedy was upstream *dropping the dependency*: `@puppeteer/browsers` 3.x replaced it with `modern-tar`, so moving the 3D worker to puppeteer 25 removed it along with the whole archive chain (`yauzl`, `fd-slicer`, `tar-fs`, `tar-stream`, `unbzip2-stream`…) for a net **−75 dependencies**. ⭐ **Severity was ALSO smaller than the alert implied, and the reason is worth keeping: it was never reachable.** `Dockerfile:124/183-184` set `PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` + `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium`, so the browser is never downloaded or unpacked and `extract-zip` was never invoked — present-but-dead code in the image. **A vulnerable transitive package in an image is not automatically a reachable one.** ⛔ **The blocking discovery was about CI, not the CVE: PR #1036 (the bot’s bump, open for days) could NOT be merged safely because its merge-base PREDATES #1049** — `scripts/ci/render-chain-paths.txt` does not exist there, so `Verify production image build` read `skipping` and the smoke gate had run **nowhere**, while six other green checks made it look verified. ⭐ **A PR opened before a CI gate existed never acquires that gate; its base is frozen, so its green answers an older question.** Re-cut from current `dev` as #1071, where the gate fired: `Verify production image build` **pass (6m36s)** with `Assert 3D preview smoke: success` in its step log — plus 10/10 smoke in a locally built release image, a real BoomBox.glb at `textured:1, broken_textures:[]`, and a Lantern.glb rendered through the running app. **Two tooling defects fixed from the agent’s report:** `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` now lives in the coding worktree’s `.env` rather than being an instruction to export (`scripts/test.sh` runs a bare `docker compose ps` you cannot prefix, so the instruction form failed the first time it mattered), and aa-brief now warns that **a deduped upload does not exercise the renderer** on the persistent seeded DB (`wrote:0, skipped:5` — a trap that arrived WITH the persistent stack). **Sprint 8 ✅ (2026-08-13) — the owner-reported empty folder, and a THIRD SQL twin.** #1026 ✅: a collection holding only saved posts had no thumbnail, because the cover composer only ever knew about `collection_resources` — #882 gave collections POSTS and nothing taught the mosaic about them. Covers are now composed **server-side** across both membership tables, ordered by the curator’s `added_at`, with a post contributing `cover_thumbnail_asset_id ?? cover_asset_id` (the preference the Post schema already specifies for a feed card). ⭐ **The reported symptom was the smaller half: the old client store never leaked a restricted picture, it CROWDED** — a withheld member occupied a mosaic slot as a blank tile, so four restricted members at the head starved every renderable member behind them. The gate now sits in the `renderable` CTE **before** the `ROW_NUMBER`, so `LIMIT 4` is taken from already-filtered rows and the skip is exact. ⭐ **`visibility.PreviewReadableSQL` is the fifth member of the twin family and was EXTRACTED, not written** — `FieldsReadableSQL` already rendered the picture-plane fragment inline, so both now call one `previewReadableExpr` and a test asserts the two are textually identical at zero mutation scope. ⚠️ **My brief was incomplete: it said “delete the client store” without noticing `/search` had its own collection-card path** — deleting it alone would have regressed every searched collection to an empty folder; the agent caught the gap and wired covers into the hit, which is sound because `keyForQuery` already includes the exact caller triple the composer reads. Two defects found by the agent’s own mutation testing and browser work rather than by the green suite: a `42P18` crash for `system.admin`/`content.read.all` (the gate short-circuits empty, leaving the caller placeholder unbound — **a gate that compiles to nothing for privileged callers puts them on a path no ordinary test takes**), and an `each_key_duplicate` that took down the entire hub page when two posts shared a cover asset (now `DISTINCT ON` before the rank, so a duplicate cannot eat a slot). ADRs 0064 and 0013 amended — **0013 now records that “does this belong in the cache entry?” is a property of the PATH, not of the value**: the same covers are an after-cache enrichment on the cached detail path and inline on the query-served list path. Verified by me in the browser at 1080p and 390px. **Sprint 7 ✅ (2026-08-13) — the derived-copy rule applied to the LAST copy, and three of the planning brief's premises corrected.** #1066 ✅ gated the CLIP embedding on `ContentReadableSQL` (the picture plane — an embedding derives from the image, so deliberately stricter than #902's field plane). ⛔ **My brief named TWO entry points; there were THREE** — `GET /assets/{id}/similar` returns ranked neighbours **with a distance on each** and is the most direct of them. ⛔ **And every surface leaked on the ANCHOR side too** — you could anchor on an asset you cannot read and harvest its neighbourhood — where all four anchor gates already carried a comment claiming to prevent exactly that, which the row predicate could not deliver. **Fourth time in this arc a comment asserted a guarantee the code did not provide.** #1023 ✅: ⛔ **the brief named the WRONG copy.** There were THREE character-for-character ladders (`posts/handler.go`, `collections/resources_page.go`, `visibility/fields.go`), and **the anonymous path cannot reach the one I named** — the row predicate floors anonymous callers to `sensitivity='public'`, so they meet a restricted asset only through a **public collection or post that holds one**. A literal reading of my brief would have patched the unreachable copy. Now one builder `visibility.OwnerDisplayNameSQL` + `users.PlaceholderOwnerName` over one shared ladder, held by an agreement test — **the third instance of ADR 0063's twin discipline**. Verified by me on the real path: restricted assets owned by opted-out users in a public collection, `public_mode` on, read logged-out → **38 items, ZERO opted-out usernames**, nulls where withheld, other owners unaffected. ⭐ **The derived-copy table is now fully green** — `search_text` (#902), facet buckets, `thumbhash` (ADR 0064), embedding (#1066). ADRs 0064 and 0070 amended; **0070 §3 now has a second consumer**, and the widening that rode along (authenticated callers get the `fullname` rung on placeholders) is safe *only* because the anonymous skip guards it. Severity note: #1023's anonymous branch is reachable only on a **public install**. **Sprint 6 ✅ (2026-08-13) — the milestone's SECURITY item, and the planning agent's design was overturned on the merits.** #902 ✅: a `restricted` asset's own withheld title sat in its `search_text`, so anyone could query a phrase only that title held, watch the total move 0→1, and **walk the title token by token** — recovering exactly what #899 removed from the payload. Now `visibility.AssetSearchMatchSQL` is the ONE expression of "this asset's text matches this caller's query", composed by `/search` hits, the `/search` COUNT and browse's `?q=`, ANDing the new `FieldsReadableSQL` (ownership + team-scoped `assets.admin` disjuncts) onto the `@@`. ⭐ **I specified a second reduced `tsvector` column; the agent showed it would be EMPTY** — `rebuild_asset_search_text` has exactly three ingredients and `FieldsReadable` withholds all three, so `@@ AND readable` and `@@ reduced-document` are identical. **And the decisive argument is robustness, not cost: a column MATERIALISES a security decision while a conjunct EVALUATES it live** — a column would enforce the old rule until rebuilt if the rule changed. My error was importing a search engine's "split by index" remedy without checking that its REASON (corpus-wide IDF, aggregation APIs) applies to Postgres; it does not, and I had already recorded that we win on that axis. ⚠️ **My scoping was wrong in BOTH directions:** `query.go:873/880` is `runPosts`, not a second asset path; the facet aggregators are FIVE matches, not one, **and all five were already closed** (every one ANDs `ContentReadableSQL` — now documented as a load-bearing dependency, since narrowing it re-opens #902 on all five); and `assets/queries.sql:134` has NO production caller — it is the oracle a parity test compares against, so gating it would have destroyed the test. Posts/collections are genuinely out of scope: a post the caller may not read is **ABSENT, not a placeholder**, so no field-withholding tier exists for a title to leak through. Verified by me by running the attack: planted tokens in a restricted title, confirmed they were in the document, then stranger **0/0/0** and browse 0 items vs owner/admin 1 — with the control that a common word gives stranger 5 and owner 6 on the SAME query, so it is per-caller and not broken search. **ADRs 0020, 0056 §4c and 0064 all amended** — 0020 now records the general form: a tier that displays something withheld has THREE channels to close (what the tile renders, what the JSON carries, what the INDEX answers). Follow-up **#1064** filed (suggest gates on the content plane). **Sprint 5 ✅ (2026-08-13) — the fallout from sprint 4, and BOTH of the planning agent's diagnoses were wrong.** #1061 ✅: I diagnosed from the HEAD of the Playwright call log (`element is not stable`) and missed the tail — `55 ×` `element is outside of the viewport`. Real cause: two `scrollTo` calls **coalesce into one scroll event** under load, so the store sees one downward move past its threshold and the chrome stays hidden. ⛔ **My headline acceptance criterion mandated CPU throttling, which CANNOT reproduce this class** — throttling scales frames and tasks equally, so it does not change what falls inside one frame (measured 10/10 and 16/16 GREEN at 6× before the fix). Followed literally the brief produced 'cannot reproduce'. Also: **the target element's own rectangle is the wrong readiness signal** and killed two candidate fixes (8/10, 9/10 failures) — recorded in an **ADR 0087 amendment**. #1060 ✅: not the `first` discriminator I briefed either. SvelteKit captures a history entry's snapshot **inside the navigation commit, for the entry being LEFT** (`client.js:1862-1863`), so a control that applied and fetched before navigating made the departing entry record the arriving entry's results — **the bug is in the capture, not the restore**. My 'decisive control' (a plain `q` change) turned out to be the one case that does NOT misrender. Fix recorded as **ADR 0056 §3c — THE ADDRESS OWNS THE FETCH**: controls write the URL and stop, the adoption performs the single fetch, a snapshot carries the signature of the results *inside* it, and a mismatched snapshot is refused along with its scroll offset. ⭐ **#584 gains a guarantee it never had** (it never verified a snapshot belonged to the address). Verified by me: `q=tile` 20 → chip 7 → **Back 20 with ZERO search requests**; forward 7, also zero. ⚠️ Accepted behaviour change: re-submitting an unchanged query is now a no-op (one fetch path, owned by the address); an explicit Refresh control is the right shape if wanted. **Sprint 4 ✅ (2026-08-13) — the representation question, answered:** #910 ✅ shipped `filter=collection:<uuid>` and, more importantly, **measured ADR 0056 §3b's extensibility claim**. Predicted one const + one case; actual **5 files beyond that, 3 backend** — and both misses were properties of the VALUE'S TYPE, not the mechanism (a UUID needs validating, or a malformed one is a Postgres `22P02` = a **500 on a caller's typo**; a value naming another ENTITY needs authorizing, and the caller-blind renderer has nowhere to put identity). ⭐ **No second query path, no bespoke parameter, no change to the wire vocabulary — so `filter=` stands as the single query representation and #911 + advanced search can be planned on it.** ⛔ It also required a **parent gate**: scoping to a collection id you cannot open would enumerate which of the assets you CAN read are curated into it — the member gate can't catch it because every disclosed row is individually readable; **the leak is the membership**. Returns empty, never 403/404 (an error is the oracle). Recorded as **ADR 0009 §3b**, the mirror of the rule §3 already stated. #1057 ✅ closed #1048 (Following now unions `team_follows` — 24 posts where a team-only follower saw 0) and #1053 (refine in place), the latter needing more than the briefed layout predicate: a same-route nav doesn't remount, so `/search` now adopts the URL via a `querySignature` `$effect` with `untrack` and a non-reactive `appliedSignature` — measured at 4 API calls per refine, not 1,694. ⚠️ **Three defects filed from this sprint's own fallout:** #1059 (the `system.admin` collection bypass now hand-copied in two places — epic #665's target), #1060 (after Back the address and results disagree — the new URL adoption races #584's snapshot restore; reached `dev` because the planning agent's browser check never pressed Back), and #1061 (the new refine-in-place spec clicks the nav box mid-transition and fails on a **contended** runner, emailing the owner — the same load-dependent shape as #1024 itself). ⛔ **Process correction from the owner: coding agents run SEQUENTIALLY, one at a time.** Two ran in parallel here; they collided in `search/+page.svelte`, producing a *semantic* merge conflict (#1058's collection chip had to join #1057's brand-new URL-adoption machinery), and the resulting overlapping CI runs are what made #1061 surface as a red push. Also filed: **#1048** — the browse Following filter consults `user_follows` only, so an account following four teams with 536 readable posts between them sees an empty feed. **Sprint 2 ✅ (2026-08-12) — the gate, then the flake:** #1049 ✅ made the 3D smoke gate reachable — `scripts/ci/render-chain-paths.txt` is now one source of truth read by both `ci.yml` (a detector job gates `docker-build` on PRs) and `dependabot-automerge.yml` (refuses to auto-merge a render-chain PR without a `success` image build), both failing closed. Proven red, skipped and green before merge; `Verify production image build` passed on a pull request for the first time. ⚠️ Two of the three premise corrections were defects in the planning brief: `docker-build` builds the **root** `Dockerfile`, not `infra/docker/app/Dockerfile` (the #470 divergence pair — and the planning agent's own hand-verification that morning had built the wrong one), and `web/src/lib/3d/*` was missing from the list although `render.html` imports its loader from there, which is the #689 seam. The third — `web/package-lock.json` cannot change what the smoke executes, because `worker.mjs` resolves `three` from its own `node_modules` — turned into the sharp cheap follow-up recorded on **#751**: a version-parity check between the two lockfiles catches the real risk in seconds with no image build. #1024 ✅ then killed the random search-test failure, and its root cause in the issue was **wrong**: not a racy `href` (Svelte flushes on a microtask, so the href is correct at click time) but SearchBar's 250 ms debounce firing `handleSearch` *after* the click and navigating away. The tell was in the failure string all along — `/?q=Iliad` carries the query, which a lost href cannot produce. Reproduced independently with no click at all. Class sweep across 54 `fill()` calls found exactly one instance. It also surfaced that a flaky non-required check **silently blocks Dependabot automerge**, since that job gates on a bare `gh pr checks`. Verifying it produced **#1053** — refining a query while on `/search` throws you to browse. **Sprint 3 ✅ (2026-08-12) — the milestone's THEME, at last:** #907 ✅ made facet buckets into filters. The shape is the point: **one typed predicate set (`facet.Selection`) rendered by BOTH the aggregators and the Engine**, so a bucket's count and the filter it labels are the same value against the same population and cannot drift by being written twice. Wire shape is repeated `filter=<dimension>:<value>` on `/search` AND `/search/facets` (a count computed without the active filter is the same defect one level up); unknown dimensions 400 rather than silently drop; **#910 is now one `FacetType` const + one case in `facet.dimensionSQL`**. No `!bang` syntax — container membership is an ordinary predicate, per the prior art. ⭐ **Five pre-existing bugs surfaced only because the struct stopped being ignored:** the `tag` facet counted `post_tags` ONLY (~2/3 of tagged corpus invisible, which made the count-equals-results acceptance *unsatisfiable* for that dimension); `Filters.Owner` used `fmt.Sscanf("%d")` so `owner:alice` produced NO filter and `owner:12abc` produced owner 12; save-as-collection resolved no capabilities (2 rows saved where the page showed 15); the saved-search executor dropped `compiled.Filters`; and the vector path re-admitted filtered rows. **A struct nothing consumes accumulates bugs silently.** The security call is recorded in **ADR 0056 §4b** with a cross-reference in **0064**: under an ACTIVE filter, rows the caller cannot open are excluded — value-independently (gated on filter *presence*, never value), so absence is not an oracle; unfiltered search is untouched. Cost recorded as **#1056**. Also corrected: **ADR 0056 §7 asserted a `facets_filter` column that was never built** |
> | v0.11.0 *(current — re-cut 2026-08-19)* | **Making and describing work** — the publication model, the create/edit surface, and the metadata system both feed. Governed by **ADR 0091** (a post is the unit of publication; an asset is personal storage; publish is reversible and drafts are real — the `wip` state existed but was unreachable), **ADR 0092** (vocabularies are searched server-side not shipped, keyword fields grow on use behind a capability, fields declare which surfaces they appear on, drift resolved by alias→merge→tombstone) and **ADR 0093** (a filtered feed composes through the search engine — one grammar, one set of gates). Sequenced: test-environment fidelity (#1198/#1170/#1054/#1211 ✅) → vocabulary as a searchable resource (#789/#1016 ✅) → field participation flags (#1173 in part ✅) → the publication model (#1161 ✅ — drafts are real and publishing is an act, collections hold posts only, an asset knows where it appears; the mosaic's leftover read of `collection_resources` is #1236 and the asset-usage UI is #1237) → the create/edit page (#1119 slice 1 ✅, #1167 ✅, #754 ✅ — epic #1119 stays open for slices 2–3; scheduled publish split out as #1238, modal/page visibility disagreement as #1240) → advanced search + edit parity (#1173, #1165, #1197, #1077) → **6** the advanced page reaches its shape ✅ (#1165 ✅ operator grammar — and it uncovered a live AND/OR bug that made adding a filter WIDEN results, #1197 ✅, #1173 slice 1 ✅ sections + live count; epic #1173 stays open for edit parity) → ⛔ **6a ✅ SHIPPED** test-environment integrity (#1245 ✅, #1125 ✅, #870 ✅, #1241 ✅ — nine deterministic failures → zero with no spec changes; ADR 0095 records that fixtures are separated by PROVENANCE not naming, after a naming heuristic nearly deleted five real assets; residuals #1247/#1248/#1249) — moved ahead of the feature sprints because the debt COMPOUNDS and every later sprint pays it: the newest 200 assets on the shared coding stack are **191 `.txt` + 9 `.glb`, ZERO images**, so `ui-30` cannot pass there and `ui-13` searches a feed whose first post is titled "Untitled"; those 9 failures are deterministic, not flaky. The corpus grew 3389→3491 in one sprint while briefs still quoted ~2,200. Fixing it late means every sprint between now and then pays the tax AND the cleanup is bigger; #1125 (a direct `go test` targets the DEV database, no `_test` guard) is a live hazard on top. → **6b ✅ SHIPPED** #1242 the pure-AI filter (`posts.ai_pure` + an `ai` grammar dimension; ADR 0094 fifth amendment records the two-column shape; also fixed a latent bug where the collections arm DISCARDED the rendered filter fragment) — ordering is FORCED, not chosen: 6c's purpose is to prove two arms compose through one engine, and today there is exactly one (`?kind=`, still standalone at `posts/list_page.go:137`), so this sprint creates the second arm that makes the convergence meaningful; the browse toggle 6c unblocks needs this sprint's derived fact anyway — a new derived fact (every contributor `generated`, over a non-empty set) plus a NEW facet dimension, which is what ADR 0093 §3 requires of a filterable dimension; cleanly additive to `selection.go` → **6c (#1251) ✅ EPIC COMPLETE** — all three slices (`kind` through the shared grammar; found the real seam was the CALLER not scope, and that ADR 0093 decision 1 was unimplementable as worded — amended) — THREE filter arms not one (`Visibility`, `Tag`, `Kinds`); slices: i the seam with `kind` only · ii absorb `Tag`+`Visibility` (settle with #1077, same seam) · iii the `BrowseFooter` AI toggle #1242 could not ship — `kind` and `ai` both composing through the engine plus the `BrowseFooter` toggle (0093's Consequences: the standalone `?kind=` converges "when the second arm arrives", and #1242 IS that arm; 0093 calls it a wide-blast-radius refactor, so it does not ride a migration sprint) → **6d ✅ folded into 6c-ii** (#1077 ✅ closed with slice 2 — same seam, one PR) — bigger than the issue states: the rail's structured `tag:` filter ALREADY matches both planes, so asset tags are selectable; what is broken is the TYPED path, and in two places (suggest completes only post_tags, AND a tag-only word is in no search document so free text would return nothing even if completed). Answer: a tag suggestion carries its dimension and applies the structured filter rather than becoming free text. Ordered after 6b because both touch `selection.go` and sprint 6 showed how subtle that file is → **7 ✅ SHIPPED** (#1238 ✅ the scheduled-publish arm + schedule-time pair refusal — ADR 0020 amended; #1240 ✅ the modal mirrors /create; scheduled UNPUBLISH accepted deliberately; the artist-facing control stays #1119) → **8 ✅ SHIPPED** the publication tail (#1236 ✅ the mosaic and the rail count compose from posts only, `GET /collections/{id}/resources` retired; #1237 ✅ the owner's asset-usage view — and its `withheld_count` arithmetic was CORRECTED: `LIMIT 200` truncation had been counted as withholding). ⛔ **The table STAYS, internal by decision** — ADR 0091's "becomes internal or disappears" resolves to *internal*, because a counter-example search found FIVE live consumers and the agent found a fifth the plan had missed (`save-as-collection` still WRITES it); the drop is its own later decision. Two traps recorded in ADR 0091: a CTE branch inheriting its column name from a removed UNION sibling (42703 on every collection read) and oapi-codegen renaming an unrelated enum once a colliding schema retires. Findings filed: #1259, #1260 → **9 ✅ SHIPPED** the test-fidelity tail (#1247 ✅ — ⛔ **the CENSUS was the leak**: every delete a spec can call is a soft delete or an archive, so `count(*)` scored correctly-cleaned fixtures as leaks and four of five tables were ALREADY clean (151 collection rows, 7 live). The census now reports live AND raw so the accumulation stays visible; three real teardown leaks fixed — and they all HAD teardown, they lacked the id because the browser makes the POST. Budget 60/26/18/30/4 → **0/0/0/0/0**, verified by an independent run ending on identical live counts. #1248 stays OPEN: the cross-file `O_EXCL` public-mode lock shipped and the contention surface was FOUR specs not two, vocab789 was a deterministic UNIQUE-code race, browse-lookahead is latency starvation not a regression — but 1195 is a REAL PRODUCT DEFECT (#1262) and I reproduced an eighth failure, `ui-13:286`, that the sprint's seven runs never caught. Findings filed: #1262, #1263) → **10 ✅ SHIPPED (2 of 3)** (#1262 ✅, #1223 ✅ — PR #1268, `197cf734`). ⭐ **#1262's real cause was not the one it was filed against**: the prop-refetch path is unreachable (#1271), and the trigger is `previewLadder.init()`'s return-early guard reading a `$state`, so the seeding effect re-ran one `GET /previews` after every open — the SECOND instance of that class here, after #918's 1,694-request loop. It also re-advanced the `if_unchanged_since` token, so a save that should have 409'd silently overwrote a concurrent edit. #1223's issue body was wrong twice over — the Modal is a portalled `div`, not a native `<dialog>` (no inertness, hence the focus gap **#1269**), and there is no document scroller to lock. ⛔ **#1263 was HELD, not merged** — preserved at `wip/1263-census-in-ci` @ `aa0aeb41`; its census works and reddened its first CI run on a REAL one-time fixture cost that no spec can fix, so merging it would have made the gate permanently red. Blocked by **#1270** → ⭐ **11a ✅ SHIPPED** the seed substrate (#1270 ✅, #1260 ✅, #1272 ✅ — PR #1273, `f473be1f`). ⭐ **45 AI-generated assets** now carry an honest `generated` declaration — the owner ruled that we produce them ourselves (*"That makes it more accurate anyways"*), 4 per team across 11 teams, CC0 1.0, and batch 2 filled registers the corpus had NONE of (storyboards, mood boards, colour scripts, concept art, photographic plates, full-screen UI mockups) because 987 of 1,027 images were Kenney packs. The false claim was **four** declarations not two (site_b too) and already in the committed profiles — but it never reached the archive MANIFEST, so the published Kaggle dataset was never affected. Verified at the column and in the browser: pure=11, labelled=12, toggle ON leaves exactly the MIXED post (an AI backplate beside Hokusai's *Great Wave*). #1270's proof: two fresh-database runs on identical counts with `sweep-fixtures` deleting nothing, twice. **→ this un-blocked #1263 ✅ CLOSED** (PR #1279, `ec267e53`) — the census now runs in CI and its first green run reported `Corpus invariant holds`: live counts identical on a fresh database (`162|94|9|27|36`), raw climbing (162→221) so the soft-delete backlog stays visible. Findings filed: **#1274** (⛔ `--reset` ensures the admin NINE LINES before the truncate that wipes it — the owner's call that seeding should just set it is right and the code already agrees), **#1275** (the archive share is AHEAD of the repo profiles; `populate_archive.py` would regress the published dataset), #1276, #1277, #1278 → **11b ✅ SHIPPED** the suite stops disagreeing with itself (#1274 ✅, #1227 ✅, #1017 ✅ — PR #1284, `bb22b37f`). **#1274 was reproduced before it was fixed**: after `--reset` the admin still logged in but held ZERO roles — stripped, not locked out. Fixed by calling `bootstrap.Run` AGAIN (not moving it — moving reintroduces #574), pinned by an invariant test that fails on pre-fix code. ⛔ **And it surfaced a real bug in the server's own boot path**: bootstrap's recovery branch announced a password it never applied and, in secure mode, overwrote `bootstrap-admin.txt` with that dead password. **#1227**: 13 candidates → 4 defects, 3 fixed 1 filed, 9 cleared — and no assertion was weakened (verified: conditionals and skips became unconditional assertions). **#1017**: the admin-profile lock reuses sprint 9's `O_EXCL` mechanism with a second resource key, 3×374/0/0/0. Findings: #1280, #1281, #1282, #1283 (the lock serialises writers not readers), ⭐ **#1285 — the 1080p scroll-lock test has NEVER run in CI**, a THIRD axis of the corpus asymmetry (subset-vs-full, not fresh-vs-persistent), recorded in ADR 0095's 2026-08-25 amendment → **12 ✅ SHIPPED** the Modal family (#1264 ✅, #1269 ✅ — PR #1286, `0c92b641`). ⭐ **The owner's ONE-editing-surface ruling shipped**: one dialog now carries name, description, all five visibility tiers, custom fields AND both cover slots with their picker, one Save, no page switch; "Set cover" retired. **#1220 folded in** — a sparse collection shrinks the panel to 1536×593 instead of leaving a dead band, and both slots render at 1536×816 identically. ⛔ The trap the suite could not catch (unmounting the inactive page loses the picker's search) was cleared and I verified it by hand. **#1269**: 43→0 escapes at 1080p, 38→0 at 390px, `aria-modal` now true — and the agent caught its own probe nearly being VACUOUS (45 Tabs through 200 tiles never reach an edge), so the spec builds a ~20-focusable fixture and asserts the anti-vacuity condition. Findings: **#1287** (focus-restore lost when the opener is a menu item — `Menu` unmounts the node `Modal` captured). ADR 0091 amended with the ruling → **13 ✅ SHIPPED** (#1243 ✅, #1255 ✅ — PR #1289, `e5a53ad3`). ⛔ **My "no API change needed" premise was FALSE and the agent caught it**: `PostMember.asset` is `allOf:[$ref Asset]`, which proves the CONTRACT permits the field and says nothing about the HANDLER — `ListPostAssets` never selected it and `memberToAsset` never mapped it, so the frontend fix alone would have shipped an unlabelled viewer with every test green. **All five view modes answered**; grid (the default) is hover/focus-revealed inside #1111's overlay, deliberately — ⚠️ I first reported that as "visible at rest" by reading the badge's own opacity and missing the `opacity:0` overlay above it. #1255 was **one component and BOTH directions** — four bare reads AND four bare writes in `AssetPlaylist`, plus five private `readLS`/`writeLS` copies converged onto one module. Findings: **#1290** (the corpus declares only `generated`; `assisted`+`none` have zero live rows, so two of four states are un-eyeballable) and **#1291** (`/search` hand-maps its cards and carries no marker). → **14 ✅ SHIPPED** (#1275 ✅, #1290 ✅, #1276 ✅ — PR #1297, `9d7e5ef9`). ⛔ **I was wrong about the blast radius and publicly "corrected" the issue**: it was **1,947 assets** (100 losing all field values, 1,847 losing 3–11 each) plus `mature` on the same set — I measured presence as a boolean and reported it as loss. Retracted. Guard verified by me read-only: dev's profile **12,097 losses** (refuses), repaired **0** (allows); duplicate ids refused NON-overridably. #1276's diagnosis inverted — the contradicting author is `omar.haddad`, a REAL persona, so `Protected` was right and the rule's own `Why` was the false claim. ⛔⛔ **And the sweep's protective tests had NEVER RUN** — `asset_types.id` vs `ref`, 42703 swallowed by a blanket `t.Skipf`, so `TestSweep_ContradictionAbortsEverything` silently skipped since #1245. The red dogfood run was **#1298 surfacing, not a regression** (zero `web/` files changed). → **14b ✅ SHIPPED** (#1295 ✅, #1294 ✅ — PR #1299, `e1fa3663`). ⛔ **SIX of my premises were wrong, including one that would have reproduced the bug**: I pointed at the `before != after` two lines above `changed += 1` as the source of a modified-count — it compares `_composition`, the fields the swap must LEAVE ALONE, so it is 0 whether every record moved or none. Marked "suggestion, overrule it", which is why it cost nothing. ⛔ **#1294's conclusion was INVERTED — the repo was stale, not the share**: profile disagreed with the POOL on 150 (site_a) / 472 (site_b), and the share matched the rebuilt pool 776/777. The three-artifact framing (profile-vs-pool / -share / pool-vs-share) is what made it answerable. ⛔⛔ **Sprint 14 had shipped a regression**: its repair of 86 `file_size_bytes` put **0 of 86** right, and the pre-existing value was closer on 85 — nothing caught it, because **#1300**: the 132-test publish-path guard suite runs NOWHERE (no workflow runs pytest at all). ⚠️ **F1 needs an owner decision** — eleven video records whose profile size, staged bytes and recorded sha256 describe two different artifacts. → **14c ✅ SHIPPED** (#1300 ✅, #1296 ✅, #1293 ✅ — PR #1305, `57db9460`). Suite 150 → 170, proven by a RED build (an injected `ImportError` and an inverted assertion each turned it red). ⛔⛔ **BOTH my grounding-11 candidates were wrong**: the generator never drifted — the published `posts.json` was **hand-curated out of band**, and the archive holds EIGHT backups (`pre-feedcurate`, `pre-hero`…) accounting for every figure #1296 reported. I theorised about the generator while the filesystem held the answer (**#1309**). ⛔ **My brief cited a predicate that no longer exists** — the sweep is now `Protected: id = ANY($1::uuid[])` (`rules.go:187`), so the danger moved to the ID, which is exactly what the migration moves; measured 68 posts REAL → UNCLASSIFIED, FIXTURE 178, CONTRADICT 0. ⛔ **ADR 0098 said 64; it is 68** — I never counted the showreels. Corrected, and amended for both false Context claims. → **14d ✅ SHIPPED** (#1301 ✅, #1302 ✅, #1303 ✅, #1306 ✅, #1304 ✅ — PR #1311, `3fbc38a6`). Guard suite 170 → 205. ⛔ **The direction of #1301 was INVERTED and I measured it myself**: 12 records disagree and in ALL TWELVE the published manifest matches the bytes on disk while the profile claims larger, 2,690,105,638 bytes of overstatement. The published dataset was never lying; the committed profile was, and the hazard sat at `populate_archive.py:841` where the profile is copied over the manifest. ⛔⛔ **My #1302 ruling was half wrong and I had said not to reopen it**: `metadata.sha256` is IDENTITY for `internet` records (`:1517` mints the id from it, `:1558-1560` three timestamps), so re-measuring would have moved ids. ⛔ **And my "titles feed no id derivation" was true of one FILE and false of the repo** — `migrate_post_ids.derived_id` parses `label` from the title; the suite went red the moment the em dash went. Six templates was TEN, plus 43 asset titles, plus a SECOND generator in Go (`runner.go:1494`) only the browser found. Titles verified BY ME on the branch: **0 em dashes at 1080p and 390px**, 128 collisions avoided via `, part N`. New: **#1312** (`CHANGED_VALUE` waves through a corrupted measurement — ADR 0097 amended), **#1313** (both sites stale), **#1314** (`post_kind` vs title, 228 posts). → **14e ✅ SHIPPED** (#1312 ✅, #1313 ✅, #1309 ✅, #1310 ✅, #1314 ✅ closed as refuted, #1308 ✅ — PR #1318, `ae61dd78`). ⭐ **The guard can now tell a corrupted measurement from a legitimate edit**, and the axis is `source_root`, never the field name: a `site`/`torrent_import`/`internet` record is staged at the destination with no reproducible source, so the destination IS the artifact and a disagreeing profile is refused; `local`/`hq`/`pack` is copied from a source the profile is built against, so a disagreement is a stale publish and is reported. `CHANGED_VALUE` deliberately unchanged. ⛔⛔ **MY BRIEF FOR #1313 WAS BACKWARDS AND WOULD HAVE CORRUPTED 392 CORRECT RECORDS.** I measured that site_b's published manifest matched the bytes on disk on all 392 and the profile on zero, and asked for the profile to be reconciled to its files. **Matching its own bytes proves only that a copy is SELF-CONSISTENT** — all 392 are `hq`, copied FROM the pool, and a pool built fresh matches the PROFILE on all 656 and the share on 264. The agent refused and was right. I wrote ADR 0097's measurement-versus-content rule the day before and applied it to the wrong noun: **the artifact is what the pipeline PRODUCES, not where it WRITES.** ⚠️ **And the real site_b defect was 17x larger and never in the issue**: 6,806 `field_values` across ALL 1,306 records at the share and not in the profile, the same shape as #1275's — I checked one field and generalised. Carried back: 6,806 filled, 0 overwritten, 1,306 ids unchanged. ⭐ **#1309 codified**: 1,513 values across 841 posts recovered from the eight `pre-*.bak` backups, five passes, no conflict rule needed because nothing changed after `pre-1217`. ⛔ **A silent no-op was one filename away** — the existing `{stem}-posts.{site}.json` convention routes through `merge_posts`, which SKIPS a post whose id it holds, so all 841 would have been skipped and the run would have reported success; now pinned by a test. **#1310**: `bundle_post_id` takes membership and nothing else; 107/216/295 ids migrated, `--check` covers 618 more posts. ⚠️ Its predicted benefit did not reproduce (15 of 340 move under BOTH keys) and the actual benefit is a different one — the anchor key read `updated_at` while the cluster sorts by `created_at`, so editing a timestamp moved an id: 1 of 340 before, 0 after. **#1314 closed as refuted**, not fixed: a fresh assembly disagrees on ZERO across 1,103 posts; the committed profile's 374 are an older generator (244), upgrade-document-authored titles (83) and pre-HQ-rename names (47). Findings: **#1319** (republish, owner-gated), **#1320** (a reseed can add rows but never correct one, and reports success), **#1322** (the committed profile is a historical accumulation, not assembler output, so every guard compares two different kinds of object). ADRs 0097 and 0098 amended. → **14f ✅ SHIPPED** (#1324 ✅, #1320 ✅ — PR #1327, `ec441fcf`). Guard suite 241 → 249, 0 skipped; 14 new Go tests, none skipped. Both defects were the same shape, a pass that cannot do its job reporting success anyway. ⛔⛔ **MY ORPHAN SIGNAL WAS BROKEN AND ONLY THE REAL CORPUS SHOWED IT.** I specified an orphan as a post row holding the same assets under an id the catalogue no longer names. Membership alone is far too weak: the published wall is **861 posts over 785 DISTINCT MEMBER SETS** (117 posts share a set, 41 colliding sets, worst collision 4), and a fresh seed against my signal reported **76 FALSE ORPHANS**. Verified by me. A third condition was added. Keying on title was considered and correctly rejected, because #1306 rewrote 774 titles in the same arc that moved the ids. ⛔ **And a trap my brief never mentioned**: `clampToPast` (#1174, `runner.go:1765`) reflects a future date around **the run's own instant** (`now.Add(-t.Sub(now))`), so two correct seeds differ. **93 of 861 published posts are future-dated** (34 `created_at` + 71 `updated_at`); a naive date comparison would have reported drift on every reseed forever. ⚠️ **My pass-enumeration table had two wrong rows** — `merge_added` and `merge_posts` DO have channels, via `audit` post-conditions at `:832` and `:888`. And **#1324's severity was overstated**: the curation document is an INPUT and survives, and `manifest_guard` covers `posts.json` at publish (`populate_archive.py:605-618`), so the loss reached a committed profile silently and would have been refused downstream. ⚠️ **The #1290 precedent I pointed at does not transfer** — `posts` carries only `posts_pkey`, no unique index, so there are no two conflict causes to tell apart; only the reporting half applied. Fix is read-only: one new SELECT, zero new writes. Exit code stays 0 by design (the remedy `--reset` is destructive and the demo box runs `set -euo pipefail`). Real-corpus evidence: fresh seed silent, second seed `resumed=861` silent, drifted DB `drifted=779` named. New: **#1328** (two more passes skip an unknown id in silence, zero instances today, guarded downstream). → **15 ✅ SHIPPED** (#1209 ✅, #1210 ✅ — PR #1332, `3f903b03`). Posts gain a focal point (migration 00062) and the picker's warning stops checking one condition of three. ⭐ **Verified BY ME on the branch, not read from the report**: a framed tile draws `preview` at `object-position: 0% 50%` with **`col` absent from its srcset**, while an unframed control still draws `col` at `50% 50%` — so #1169's ladder work is preserved for every post WITHOUT a focal point, which is better than the acceptance asked. ⛔⛔ **TWO OF MY PREMISES WERE WRONG AND ONE I HAD ALREADY GOT RIGHT.** (a) "The picker already has a home" was FALSE for posts: `PostHost.svelte:555` was `stubAction('Edit post')` and **zero clients sent `PATCH /posts/{id}`**, so the surface had to be built. (b) I read `featuredCrop.ts` correctly in planning (collections crop **4:3**), then OVERTURNED my own correct reading by citing `collections/models.go`'s doc comment — which is a verbatim statement of the reasoning `featuredCrop.ts:24-37` exists to correct. Square is right for posts because the **grid tile** is square. A correct answer through a false premise (**#1334**). ⚠️ And the plural case was subtler than I framed it: since #1169 `coverSrcsetFor` returns a **MIXED** set, so the browser picks a pre-cropped rung at SOME tile widths — right framing at one tile size, wrong at another. ⚠️ **My own review made both mistakes this arc keeps teaching**: I nearly reported acceptance 9 as contradicted while measuring a container whose image predated both commits, and my evidence for THAT was a `strings` probe a control proved returned zero for a column that has existed for months. The timeline evidence held; the instrument did not. New: **#1333** (⛔ changing a cover keeps the old focal point, on posts AND collections — a real data-correctness hole in shipped code, not new in #1210), **#1334** (the misleading crop-shape comments), **#1335** (the coding stack has never had fixtures seeded, so 6 dogfood specs fail there on every branch). → **16a ✅ SHIPPED** (#1326 ✅, #1334 ✅, #1333 ✅ — PR #1337, `a179f18b`). ⚠️ **#1307 STAYS OPEN**, see below. ⛔⛔ **MY BRIEF'S SCOPING CLAIM WAS FALSE.** I said the i18n guard bounds the work because components carry no raw English "by construction"; `TRACKED_FILES` holds **68 of 251** components and its own comment says deferred files stay OUT deliberately. **245 visible em dashes remain across 130 files** (105 `<title>` separators, 73 prose, 67 placeholders). Caught only because the brief said to verify the guard before relying on it. ⛔⛔ **AND THE SERVER FIX ALONE WOULD HAVE SHIPPED THE BUG ANYWAY**: `CollectionCoverEditor.assign()` set the asset id and nothing else, so it composed an explicit STALE focal into its save, which the server honours BY DESIGN — the exact arm I specified. A correct API plus a buggy client reproduce the original defect. ⭐ **A server rule that honours what the client sends is only as good as its callers.** ⚠️ **#1333 was wider than I scoped**: collections carry SIX crop columns over two slots and `cover_zoom` had the identical hole. **#1334 was five places not two**, including THREE blocks of the published `openapi.yaml`, and the source was a MIGRATION (`00055:132`) not `schema.sql`, which is sqlc's INPUT — editing it alone would have left every real database wrong. The square's origin was a neighbouring comment saying "a collection card is roughly square". Verified by me at 1080p and 390px: **zero visible em dashes in the page body**; the tab still reads `Account — Artist Alley`, which is the out-of-scope title separator. New: **#1338** (the seeded titles still carry em dashes, the owner's ORIGINAL complaint, and it cannot be a sed because post ids derive from titles). ⏭️ **#1288 DEFERRED to v0.12.0** (owner, 2026-08-28: *"not worry about icons this tag ... a later polish pass since this doesn't really matter for searching"*). Grounding recorded on the issue so it is not re-derived: **61 files / 139 SVGs in scope** once the whiteboard is excluded (which the owner also deferred, 5 files / 32 SVGs, pending its own overhaul); **only 4 files import the icon set at all**, so it is first-time adoption at scale rather than a swap; the top 7 files carry 58 of 139 while 47 carry one or two; ADR 0096 already specifies the mechanism and the artwork exception. ⚠️ The icon-versus-artwork split **cannot be made by filename** — I tried and `WhiteboardToolPanel` classified as artwork while its 24 glyphs are labelled things like "Swap primary and secondary colors". → **16b ✅ SHIPPED** (#1292 ✅ — PR #1343, `dcefc50a`). The dim `HIDE` section is gone; AI and Mature are ordinary icon+label+checkbox rows under **Content**, `role="switch"` retired, a tick means SHOW. Verified by me at 1080p and 390px on a rebuilt binary. ⛔⛔ **I MISSED THE ADR AMENDMENT THAT HAD ALREADY DECIDED THIS.** ADR 0090 carries a **#1292 amendment dated 2026-08-26** naming three layers, putting this menu at layer 3, ruling it narrows and never consents, defaults to included, and that both cascade rungs are ABSENCE not disablement. It even answers the question I escalated as an open product call: *"Presenting them as one category is right for the reader, who is answering one question; building them on one mechanism is not."* **I read §2 and stopped**, which is exactly what the brief-writing rule warns about. ⛔ **And my naming argument was backwards and would have shipped a regression.** I claimed 0090 sets a "name permissively" contract so `aa_browse_hide_ai` should become `show_ai`. The contract is *"its ZERO VALUE is the safe answer"*; permissive naming follows from that FOR MATURE. The AI filter never gates, so its safe answer is opposite, and `readHideAI` returns false when absent. **Renaming would have inverted the default to hiding AI work for every reader who never touched the control.** ⚠️ Two issue-body claims were also false: the preference-clobbering hazard is REAL (server-side `UserPreferencesRequest`, an absent member is a reset) and I refuted the wrong mechanism; and the row DID have a `Sparkles` icon. ⛔ **The gate had been CANCELLED, not passed**, and mergeState read UNSTABLE, so it would have merged with its named gate unrun. On re-run it FAILED on the sprint's own signed-out case: a fresh install has anonymous browsing OFF (`publicmode.go:49-50`), so a signed-out visitor gets a sign-in form, not a wall. ⭐ **The lesson is not the timeout: with the switch off there is no filter menu at all, so "the mature row is absent" would have held AGAINST A LOGIN CARD.** Only the wall assertion made it fail loudly instead of passing silently.

Only ONE real skip was new. ⭐ **The instrument I used to characterise the problem WAS the problem**, the third time this arc a measurement I trusted was the thing at fault. ⛔ **And that killed the count-gate design I sketched**: CI and the workstation skip DIFFERENT tests (CI: anon + `modal-scroll-lock-1223`; workstation: anon + two-kind), same tally of 2, overlapping by one. A `SKIP <= N` gate would have watched a skip appear and one disappear and reported neither. **Shipped as a MANIFEST OF NAMES** (`skip-manifest.txt`, 95 lines) with **exit 6**: a declared test that did not run, or a skip not in the manifest. `SKIP` and `NOTRUN` are now separate, so a cascade reads as a cascade. ⭐ **The anonymous kind-filter case now RUNS on CI** (run `33221187932`, `✓ 99 ...

Refining resets the results region through `scrollportOf`; ADR 0056 gained an amendment because §3c decides what a RESTORE does and was silent on a fresh search. `smart_query` narrowed to provenance; ADR 0091 note. #1159's paging rig extracted and mounted by `/search`. ⛔⛔ **THREE OF MY BRIEF'S PREMISES WERE WRONG AND THE AGENT CAUGHT ALL THREE.** (1) I wrote "there is no Phase 1.16.B-4" in the brief AND in #1259's body; **B-4 shipped** as the `saved_search` table (`schema.sql:2645`), `internal/search/saved/`, `/account/saved-searches` and two admin surfaces. It was never built on `collections.smart_query`, which is the actual reason that column has no consumer. (2) I said the storage half of `hideMature` was already right because it removes the key rather than writing `0`; that holds with ONE default, and with two it erases an exempt moderator's deliberate include on the next load. Tri-state, both values written. (3) I scoped the scroll reset to two surfaces; the browse wall has **no visible symptom** (a 900-card wall at 29457px already lands at 0 because `items = []` collapses it and the browser clamps), so its spec is labelled a characterisation guard, not a regression guard. ⛔ **AND THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHIPPED A GUARD THAT NEVER RAN.** The #1354 spec picked a seeded term returning 10 hits, so on CI's 162-asset corpus its precondition was never true and it skipped itself: the sprint's headline feature had **zero CI coverage**, caught only by 17a's exit-6 denominator gate. Picking another term was the wrong remedy (the CI profile is a greedy set-cover selected for DIVERSITY, the worst corpus for a repeated term); the guard now **manufactures** its second page. A second guard defect died before merge: "buffer >= one scrollport" measured 1.73 screenfuls at 1280x400 but **0.27 at 1920x1080**, and page one alone satisfied it. ⭐ **Fourth member of the vacuous-guard family**: skipped, uninvoked, vacuous, and now **satisfied-by-the-bug**.

Three measured mechanisms break the one-to-one: (1) **a deduplicating create**, since `POST /api/v1/assets` dedups per user on `(owner_user_ref, file_hash)` and the DEFAULT `warn` behaviour answers **HTTP 200 carrying the existing asset's id** (`assets/handler.go:850-858`, verified independently), so ui-12's per-worker `beforeAll` uploading the same one-pixel PNG produces two successful creates with ONE id; (2) **an idempotent delete**, a second DELETE answering 204 and counting again; (3) **a revive is not a create**, `ensureProbeField` PATCHing an archived probe back to active. ⭐ **Why CI could never show it**: `playwright.config.ts:105` runs ONE worker on CI and TWO locally, so the shape is unreachable in CI. Four CI runs checked during planning all read `LEFT 0` for assets; the issue's `MADE 2 GONE 1 LEFT 1` came from a local run. ⛔ **And the reproducible anomaly nobody could see**: `collections -1` and `field_definition -1` on EVERY run across three commits, with the responsible spec hidden because `fixture-ledger-report.mjs:68` pushed an attribution row only `if (net > 0)` while the totals summed all nets, printing *"Every spec removed everything it created"* directly above a negative `LEFT`. Now: the report nets **by row id** so `LEFT` cannot go negative, the three shapes are named anomalies (`DEDUP`/`REDEL`/`FOREIGN`), and two new gates run from `run-ui.sh` (checked, not assumed, per #1300): `fixture-ledger.test.mjs` (15 cases, **8 of 9 reporter cases fail against the pre-fix arithmetic**) and **`fixture-ledger-reconcile.mjs`, exit 7**, which compares ledger `LEFT` against the census delta. ⭐ **Nothing had ever compared those two numbers**, which is why this sat undetected. ⚠️ Single unreproduced observation, not filed: `ui-18-site-text` "override renders on the public surface, revert brings it back" timed out once on the revert control, then passed in isolation and on rerun.

Each arm is now **positioned by the cursor in SQL**; because `NormalisedScore` has no SQL column the fragment renders the division into the predicate as `ROW(ts_rank_cd(...)::FLOAT8 / $max, id) < ROW($last_score, $last_id)`, so Postgres and Go do the SAME IEEE-754 division on the same doubles and the boundary row can be neither duplicated nor skipped. Multiplying back was rejected as a different rounding. ⭐ **The planning fact that carried the fix**: the per-query maximum is preserved by MEASURING it, not by re-fetching the top of the ranking. Page 1's window still starts at `score DESC` so the max is free; later pages run one `COALESCE(MAX(...))` per arm. `perEntityLimit` stays `limit * 3`, always honest merge headroom and only accidentally a ceiling. Keyset args ride the HITS list only, so `total_count` is untouched. ⭐ **ADR 0056 needed NO amendment**: payload still `{last_score, last_id, last_type}`, normalisation still per-query per-entity max, so this restored compliance rather than deciding anything. Measured by me on the branch stack: 524/524 at limits 10, 25 and 100 (53, 21 and 6 pages), 648/648 across three types, 124/124 for posts, **zero duplicates and zero ordering breaks**; before, the same queries reached 30, 75 and 300 of 523. Page 1 preserved (the two stacks' sequences are identical offset by one, the coding corpus holding one extra matching asset), which matters because save-as-collection persists page 1 in rank order and the saved-search executor hashes its id set. ⭐ **The guard is portable ON PURPOSE**: `cursor_exhaustion_test.go` has 452 added lines and ZERO references to anything the PR introduces, so it runs against the unfixed engine (15 of 48 at limit 5, 30 of 48 at limit 10, the proportional ceiling); the fragment's unit test lives separately. ⛔ Hybrid untouched, `armCursor` nil whenever `SimilarityHint` is set; its union count contract is **#1364**, deferred to the embedding/CLIP arc.

Three compounding defects, all confirmed: the save path posted only the query text; `walkFieldMatch` ASSIGNED rather than appended for `owner`, `sensitivity`, `asset_type` and `extension`, so `extension:png AND extension:jpg` collapsed to `jpg`; and `field:` was not representable in the DSL at all. Fixed by canonical `Selection -> DSL -> Selection` serialisation over the six savable dimensions, with the query expression preserved as one PARENTHESISED operand. ⭐ **Verified by driving the real Save Search dialog**, not a constructed request: at 1080p a 2-of-3 filtered search stored `(tilemap) AND extension:png` and replayed to the IDENTICAL id set; at 390px a top-level OR stored `(icon OR pack) AND extension:png`. That parenthesis is the whole precedence guarantee, since `AND` binds tighter than `OR` (`parser.go:171`) and the unwrapped form would silently mean `icon OR (pack AND extension:png)`. ⭐ **Two accepted deviations from my brief, both the agent's and both right.** (1) The SERVER composes the canonical DSL, not the browser: a TypeScript quoting implementation cannot be derived from the Go lexer and would be a second hand-maintained grammar, which ADR 0093 decision 3 refuses; the browser posts filter tokens in the same wire form save-as-collection has used since #907. Persistence is unchanged, one canonical string, no merge rule. (2) `CompiledQuery.FreeText`: **my data-flow trace stopped at `Filters` and missed `Query.Text`**. `TSQuery` has no consumer outside its own package and both DSL callers put the WHOLE DSL string into `Query.Text`, so `(cat) AND extension:png` would have reached `plainto_tsquery` as text terms. ⚠️ **Found during landing, not fixed here**: the timer executor resolves no capabilities, so `run-now` and interactive search can see different corpora. A saved search on the plainest possible DSL (`tilemap`, no filter, no new code path) replays 0 where interactive returns 3, which makes `run-now.hit_count` an unreliable oracle for admin-visible behaviour. → **18b ✅ SHIPPED** (#1173 in part, PR #1373, `3bf2f887`; landing correction PR #1374, `21727c8e`) typed ordered comparison, ordered non-field grouping, `file_size`. ⭐ **The root cause was that the storage column was chosen from the OPERATOR, not from the quantity**: `dimensionSQL` picked `value_date` on `>=`/`<=`, and `canonicalBound` accepted only RFC3339 or `2006-01-02`. An operator says which side of a bound a row falls on and nothing about what is bounded. A bound now carries a DOMAIN: temporal to `value_date`, numeric to `value_num`, bytes to `file_size_bytes` as exact `int64` with no float64 path. Wire spelling `filter=file_size:>=12345` (the operator lives in the value half); `file_size>=12345` names no dimension and stays malformed. Measured on the real corpus: `polycount>=1000` 515, `<=5000` 271, **both 209**, and `515+271-209=577` is exactly the populated set, so the old one-subgroup OR would have returned every asset carrying a polycount. `file_size` intersection 375 against 456/443 of a 524 baseline, union again exactly 524. Cross-arm proven with a live control: `q=collection` returns 4 assets + 9 collections + 5 posts, and adding `file_size:>=1` leaves 4 assets and **zero** of each other arm. ⭐ **Two of the agent's own assertions were vacuous and only MUTATION TESTING found them**: the `Authorize` type check was untested because every incompatible type was refused twice over, and the only discriminator is `boolean` (ADR 0012 stores it 0/1 in `value_num`, the same column a numeric bound reads); and "exactly zero posts" passed against a deliberately broken cross-arm because the fixture had no post. ⛔ **Fifth and sixth members of the vacuous-guard family**: skipped, uninvoked, vacuous, satisfied-by-the-bug, refused-twice-over, premise-absent. ⛔⛔ **AND THE MERGE BROKE THE DOCS SITE.** Three gates went green (ADR frontmatter, MDX hazard check, Site rebuild trigger) and `artist-alley-site`'s Build verify still failed: `Unexpected character '=' before name` at `0093...mdx:465:31`.

Identity `<domain>/<code>` plus `none`, never the row UUID. `AssetDomain(ref)` is literally `"asset:" + ref` (`service.go:47-49`), and the live catalogue is `asset:1` (draft initial, pending_review, published, archived, deleted) and `post` (wip, published initial). ⛔ **ASSET-ONLY, and the post arm is a STRUCTURAL exclusion rather than an omission.** A post carries `state_id` too and that does NOT make it filterable: `visibility.postPublishedExpr` keeps a `wip` post off every shared surface *including search*, waived by one option whose sole production caller is the author's own drafts listing, so `post/wip` is unreachable through search for everyone (author and `posts.admin` holder included) and `post/published` is tautological. Collections have **no `state_id`** at all. Both unsupported arms fall out through the EXISTING `satisfiable=false` path (`FacetExtension`'s shape since #907), never a second exclusion mechanism. `none` means `state_id IS NULL` on the asset arm. ⚠️ A well-formed identity naming no row is **accepted and matches zero**, never a 400: `CanonicalValue` is pure, #897 lets operators delete states, and a saved query must stay parseable. The FK is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so a **deleted** state's identity returns zero and must NEVER degrade into `none`, which would silently widen every saved query that named it. A **non-asset** domain such as `post/published` is accepted and matches any asset actually carrying it, because asset create does not validate the domain and surfacing that misfiling is the point. ⚠️ The asset identity contains a colon, so HTTP keeps it after the first-colon cut while **DSL must QUOTE it** via 18a's `lexesAsOneBareWord`, which runs the real lexer rather than checking a character list. Enumerated dynamically through `ListWorkflowStates` so #897's operator-defined states appear with no code change. ⚠️ Only POSTS transition in production (`posts/publication.go:461`, `TransitionInTx`); assets cannot, and their five populated states are seeded. → **18d ✅ SHIPPED** (#1173 in part, PR #1383, `c7139251`) the resource and media advanced-search sections, formerly 18c, relabelled when 18b split. Resource: contributor (`owner`) and workflow state. Media: file type (`extension`), file-size range, and pixel-dimension numeric ranges. Full text is NOT a new control: the words box and the query builder already ARE the full-text surface, and a second one would be a second `q` that can drift from the first. ⛔ **`sensitivity` is NOT in 18d.** #1173's body names the resource section as full text, workflow state and contributor, with zero occurrences of sensitivity or access level anywhere in it; the earlier wording here was scope this epic never authorised. It stays a shipped dimension with no advanced control, available to a later slice. ⚠️ **The page today emits ONLY `type:` and `field:` terms**: owner, sensitivity, extension, workflow_state and file_size have zero frontend presence, measured in the browser at 1080p and 390px. The earlier claim that owner, sensitivity and extension already existed was false. ⭐ **The live result count IS preservation**: `searchParams()` is the one composer feeding both the Search button and the count, debounced and generation-guarded, so a control that adds its terms there inherits the count and cannot drift from the submitted query. ⭐ **Pixel dimensions ship through the EXISTING configured-field machinery** (`FieldDef` + `ranges` + `fieldTerms()` + the canonical `field:` grammar), not a bespoke dimension: 18b removed the `value_date` blocker and only the frontend's numeric family was still missing. Media presents a pixel field only while its `applies_to` is empty; a type-scoped one follows the per-type sections instead, so operator configuration is honoured rather than inferred. ⛔ **18d mutates NO `field_definition` data**, not `applies_to`, not `show_in_advanced_search`. Contributor needs the one new backend surface in the slice: a narrow read-only authenticated lookup returning `user_ref` plus a label, restricted to owners of assets the caller can already see, self-excluding its own `owner:` terms through the existing `Selection.ForFacet` drill-down rule so a second owner stays selectable. ⭐ **SHIPPED WITH A SEMANTIC CORRECTION THE SPRINT FOUND**: the pixel control emitted a correct term that matched nothing, because `fieldGate` and the `field:` execution SQL both conjuncted `field_definition.searchable`, a flag whose only real consumer is the full-text index builder (`rebuild_asset_search_text`) and which migration 00017 sets false on the pixel fields precisely so a number stays out of the tsvector. Both conjuncts are removed; the index builder keeps its own. So an explicit `field:` predicate is now independent of index participation, gated by `status` plus `read_capability` through `Selection.Authorize` as before. ⚠️ **Replay changes in place, generally**: no DSL text or CacheKey migration, but any active readable `searchable=false` field, operator-created ones included, can turn a previously silent-empty saved or scheduled search into one that matches. Out: orientation, preview availability, featured collections. → **19 ✅ SHIPPED** (#1173 in part, PR #1388, `78e09905`) the field-configuration settings an operator cannot reach. Two genuinely absent columns, `read_only` and `regexp_filter`, both enforced server-side at the existing value-write handlers for BOTH subject kinds (`SetAssetFieldValue`/`ClearAssetFieldValue` and `SetCollectionFieldValue`/`ClearCollectionFieldValue`). Plus the missing operator control for `searchable`: the column already persists through both the create and update API and appears in NO admin surface, so the simple-search half of the participation pair #1173 scheduled is the one nobody can set. Help text reuses the existing `description` column; no new storage. ⛔ **`searchable` means FULL-TEXT INDEX PARTICIPATION ONLY, never structured `field:` filterability** (sprint 18d removed that conflation; do not let the control's wording restore it). ⭐ Reindex is inherited, not designed: #1016 already rebuilds field-scoped `search_text` synchronously after the definition commit. ⭐ Most of the epic's list ALREADY EXISTS on `field_definition`: `show_in_advanced_search`, `applies_to` (the per-type scoping), `edit_tab`, `show_on_upload`, `required`, `status`, `default_value`, read/write capabilities, `open_vocabulary`. Verified missing (all zero columns): **`display_condition`, `read_only`, `regexp_filter`**, plus help/tooltip text. Placed after 18 because conditional visibility is consumed by the EDIT surface, not by search. ⭐ **SHIPPED WITH TWO CORRECTIONS THE SPRINT FOUND.** `rich_text` was dropped from the pattern's supported types: its `value_text` is SANITIZED HTML, so a pattern would match markup rather than the words an operator sees. And the brief's citation for asset `required` was wrong: both checks live inside the MIRRORED helpers, so a required NON-mirrored asset field accepts an empty value and can be cleared. That is a real pre-existing defect, found by tracing the actual `required` checks, and filed as #1389 in v0.12.0 rather than absorbed here. A SEPARATE finding during verification: `run-ui.sh` keeps the literal `--` from its own documented passthrough form and hands it to Playwright, so a filtered invocation runs the whole suite. That is #1390, also v0.12.0. Two independent findings, not one causing the other. → **20a ✅ SHIPPED** (#1389 ✅, #1173 in part, #1119 in part, PR #1394, `9759b4fd`) edit parity reaches assets. `/assets/{id}/edit` had never rendered a field value: the only frontend writer of `PUT /assets/{id}/fields/{field_id}` was the upload flush, so every flag 18b and 19 shipped was reachable at upload time and nowhere else, while collections had had a field editor since 1.9.B. The generic section skips `mirrors_column` definitions, `FieldValueInput` gained `read_only` and `regexp_filter` across all three of its hosts at once, and per-field stale-edit detection landed on the value rows' own `set_at` with an `if_absent` first-write guard and a present/absent 409. ⛔ **#1389 blocked this slice and is now closed**: `required` was unenforced on the ordinary Set/Clear paths for BOTH subject kinds, so the required marker the new section renders would have been a lie; `rich_text` emptiness is semantic rather than `TrimSpace`, sharing one predicate with the shipped display rule. ⭐ **THREE things the sprint found that the plan had not.** Clearing a value was broken on EVERY surface, not just absent on assets: no web caller issued `DELETE`, every emit path collapsed empty to `null`, and both validators rejected the resulting omission, so an optional value could not be removed at all. `boolean` was the one control that could neither represent nor display unset, since a stored `false` and an absent value both rendered as an unticked box; it became a three-state select. And the guard had to be the WHERE clause of the mutating statement, because all four handlers run at READ COMMITTED where a handler-side check in front of the existing unconditional upsert stays green on every sequential test while two overlapping guarded writes both return 200. Residuals filed to v0.12.0: #1395, #1396, #1397, #1398. → **20b ✅ SHIPPED** (#1173 in part, #1119 in part, PR #1400, `3d53230a`) the edit surface gains composition. `edit_tab` shipped in 18b and had ZERO consumers until now; `display_condition` did not exist at all, and neither did any of 98 ADRs describing it, so ADR 0099 was written before the behaviour it governs. A condition is a jsonb array of bare `<code><op><value>` terms parsed by the EXISTING `SplitFieldTerm`, conjunctive, `=` and `~` only: the search grammar was not extended. Consumed by asset edit, collection edit and `/create`, with asset type staying the outer axis there and same-named tabs across types never merging. ⛔ **The security seam was the real work.** Deciding whether to draw a control needs to know whether the CALLER may read the CONTROLLER, and the browser cannot answer that: `auth.caps` carries only global codes, so a team-scoped grant is invisible to it. A `readable:false` flag beside a leaked value would have been no protection at all, so two new composition reads carry `{field_id, field_code, readable}` and NO value member, making non-disclosure structural; `GetAssetFields` gained the per-field permission filter the collection twin already had. ⭐ **Three things the sprint found that the plan had not.** Whole-condition fail-open is not "unknown counts as true inside the AND": with one term FALSE and another unevaluable an AND would still hide, so the condition itself is indeterminate and SHOWS. Applicability had to be an N-WAY intersection, since three definitions can pass every pairwise check and still share no asset type. And acyclicity is not a property of any row, so two operators writing A→B and B→A could each validate before the other committed; a transaction-scoped advisory lock holds it, proved by a race whose contenders are observed blocked in `pg_stat_activity` rather than merely raced. Peer review returned it twice: `/create` had dropped its `display_group` fieldsets, and a line-per-term editor would have split a term whose value contains a newline into two. → **20c (#1173, #1119)** batch metadata edit, the early subset of ADR 0019. **20c-i ✅ SHIPPED** (PR #1404, `d0c6ce4d`) the server half: preview and apply, the four modes, a caller-bound single-use token whose consumption commits with the writes and the one audit envelope, the five-gate stack, and the 500-entry / 1,000-target ceilings. ⛔ **20c-i needed a post-merge correction** (PR #1410, `23025984`): the apply held a `posts` row lock taken by an earlier target's write while acquiring the NEXT target's `assets` row, inverting the order every ordinary metadata write takes, and post-merge CI deadlocked with `40P01`. Corrected by locking the whole asset tier (subjects plus any reference target) `FOR UPDATE` in ONE ascending statement, suppressing per-row asset-to-post search propagation inside the batch transaction and coalescing it into one ascending rebuild after the writes, and making `rebuild_post_search_text` lock its post BEFORE reading membership, member documents or tags (migration 00067). ⭐ That last change also fixed a PRE-EXISTING bug reachable with no batch involved: two ordinary writes on assets sharing two posts acquired those posts in opposite orders and deadlocked. Apply p95 at the ceiling moved 20.16 s to 0.83 s; contention against a batch TARGET moved the other way and is recorded as measured. ⛔ Execution is SYNCHRONOUS and bounded, NOT job-queued, so ADR 0019's job choice is superseded for these four modes while #39 keeps it for the unbounded ones: the coordinator-plus-child shape this line used to cite was half absent (soft-delete GC has no children at all), and `jobs` carries neither a parent link nor a progress column. **20c-ii ✅ SHIPPED** (PR #1421, `7ed74f5c`) the client half: the selection store now carries an explicit `{kind, id}` identity, the `SelectionBar` moved to the app shell so a selection is actionable from every surface that can create one, and the batch panel drives the shipped preview and apply endpoints. ⭐ The census that sized it corrected this line's own premise: selection was reachable on ELEVEN route patterns (ten logical surfaces, the two profile URLs being one), not three, and only browse had an action surface, so nine could strand a selection. ⚠️ Sprint 20c is now COMPLETE, but #1173 and #1119 stay open for reasons that have nothing to do with 20c: #1173 for its special advanced-search verbs (`!last N`, `!nopreviews`, `!list`, now scheduled as sprint 25) and #1119 for the sprint 21 create/edit residual. ⛔ The selection store USED TO hold a bare string while `/search`, `/teams/{id}` and the profile each mounted both card kinds, so one selection could hold post ids and asset ids with no discriminator; it now carries an explicit `{kind, id}` and posts expand to assets SERVER-side through `post_assets`, which is many-to-many, so 3 posts is not 3 assets. Preview is mandatory and returns the resolved set partitioned eligible / inapplicable / unauthorized plus a token; execution takes the TOKEN, so the executed denominator cannot drift from the previewed one. Four modes only (overwrite, fill-empties, append, remove); the reference's locked-fields cascade needs an exemplar and per-field locks that do not exist here and does not transfer. #39 keeps the other eight actions in v0.15.0. → **21 (#1119)** the create/edit residual. `/create` is already a real 729-line PAGE. The pieces IDENTIFIED SO FAR are schedule wiring, cover and visibility, a per-post comments toggle that exists NOWHERE in the codebase, and two upload-flow bugs whose own bodies place them in this epic: a successful publish leaves the originating surface stale until a manual refresh (#1407), and same-drop texture files are not auto-matched as model companions (#1408). ⚠️ The first three were INVENTORY inferred from translation keys and section headings rather than from driving the page, so the slice was re-grounded from current code and decomposed into 21a through 21e before any of it was sized. **21a ✅ SHIPPED** (#1407, PR #1427, `a44be98e`) the originating surface stops lying. A successful publish through the globally mounted upload dialog now reaches the page it was made from with no browser reload: the browse feed, a collection, a team page, a profile and the results page each re-ask the server rather than inventing a row, so the server representation stays the authority. Order, cursor and the reader's scroll survive, nothing resets to the first page, and no row appears twice. ⭐ The paging half was the real work: a refresh firing while a list request was already in flight would have discarded the page the reader had asked for, or let a pre-publish answer land on top of a fresh one, so all five consumers route the announcement through a refresh gate that defers instead of racing, and a publish arriving while busy is remembered rather than dropped. A refused publish refreshes nothing, the results page keeps its address so ADR 0056's refine reset is untouched, and `/create` keeps its own navigation. **21b ✅ SHIPPED** (#1408, PR #1425, `0dd97a24`) same-drop companion reconciliation: a model and the files it declares can be supplied in one batch and arrive attached, relative paths survive a folder drop so `textures/foo.png` matches the path the model names, an ambiguous name is asked about rather than guessed, and a companion attached after the row is ready really uploads and clears its requirement. Both the upload modal and `/create` carry it. The server's exact path matching rule was not changed. **21c ✅ SHIPPED** (#1119 in part, PR #1429, `b3d6ccd7`) the real post editor. "Edit post" in `PostHost` was an alert; it now opens one editing surface for title, description, visibility, tags, cover choice and cover framing, shaped after the collection editor per ADR 0091's one-surface ruling, and the separate cover control folded into it as a section. Saves go through the existing `PostUpdate` with its `if_unchanged_since` guard, so a stale edit is refused rather than overwriting a newer one, and the editor re-reads the server's answer instead of trusting its own. Publishing and unpublishing stay their own action through the existing endpoints, so editing metadata cannot move a draft or take a published post down. Collection membership is listed but stays the collection's to decide: removal is offered only where the caller may already mutate that collection, authorship of the post grants nothing over another's collection, and removing from one leaves the rest untouched, proven with a seeded non-admin author against a mixed-authority pair. ⭐ The editor was the first real caller to send `tags` on a PATCH, and that surfaced a latent data-loss bug: `ReplacePostTags` deleted every tag that survived a replace, because the delete and the insert in one statement each saw the row the other was acting on. Fixed so the two halves touch disjoint rows. Epic #1119 stays open for 21d and 21e. → **22 (#1322, #1328, #1335, #1338)** the pre-republish seed tail, batched because all four must land before #1319 and none is urgent alone: the rebuild must refuse to overwrite the committed profile; two passes still skip an unknown id in silence (zero instances today); the coding stack has never had fixtures seeded so six specs fail there on every branch; and the seeded titles still carry em dashes, which is entangled with post-id migration and cannot be a sed. → **24 (#1417)** free-text kind terms. The structured `kind:` filter already finds a post through ANY readable member's kind (#1190, converged onto the grammar by 6c) and ordinary free text does not, because no canonical `viewkind` value ever reaches a searchable document: `rebuild_asset_search_text` builds from title, description and searchable field values only, so the kind word is absent from the asset document and therefore from the post document that folds it. Moved into this tag 2026-09-08 by the owner as part of the searching/finding correctness arc. ⚠️ **Deliberately NOT folded into 25**: the mechanism is the free-text document and matching path rather than a grammar dimension, and it carries two undecided calls of its own, the disclosure boundary (the shared post document folds public members only since #883, so a caller-specific answer cannot come from it) and the ranking weight relative to title, description, tags and member text. Not yet sized. → ⛔ **25 (#1173 special search verbs)** the owner's residual, and **its OWN sprint by their ruling** (2026-08-16: *"Decompose as its own sprint inside this epic"*): `!last N`, `!nopreviews`, `!list`. A verb dimension on the one-grammar composition, each verb stating its visibility story explicitly, because no verb bypasses the row plane and the #902 family applies to any verb that could reveal existence. **This is what keeps epic #1173 open.** Not yet decomposed. → ⛔ **23 (#1319)** the republish, LAST and OWNER-RUN. **Blocked until v0.11.0 is at zero open**, by the owner's ruling, because the corpus is the test fixture the remaining sprints are written against and the archive has no backup. It is a write to `/mnt/blackbox_archives`, then Kaggle at the tag. 14f measured the gap it closes at **779 drifted posts**. ⚠️ It was previously sequenced between 14f and 15, which was wrong: it reads as next when it is structurally last.  the metadata + search arc, brought back into this tag 2026-08-26 (owner: *"metadata field system is part of search"*). ⭐ **One arc, not two** — #1173's part 4 (edit-surface parity) is explicitly sequenced with #1119, and #1119 consumes #1173's field-config flags and vocabularies. **#1173's own foundation order governs the split**: (18) field-config participation/scoping flags + the dynamic keyword type, because everything else consumes them; (19) the advanced-search page sections + live count; (20) edit parity + the full-page create/edit surface. ⚠️ **Not yet decomposed** — these three are the shape, not a plan; each needs its own grounding pass, and #1173 supersedes #1165's residual scope and shapes #1166 and #789. ⚠️ **This is what gates the tag**: without them v0.11.0 was four sprints out; with them it is roughly seven or more, and #1173 alone is a schema change plus a vocabulary type plus a search surface plus edit parity.

## Release candidate

Added 2026-08-06 on the owner's direction:

> *"We are going to need to have a release candidate when we finish the roadmap and all
> epics/issues. This is where we try to get users to test it for me and make sure there aren't any
> other bugs before we cut the 1.0.0 release."*

**Entry:** every milestone through v1.0.0 at zero open issues, every epic closed. The RC is not a
parallel track — it starts when the roadmap is finished.

**Exit:** an explicit owner decision, not a timer. The useful bar is *no open RC-reported issue
that would be a release-blocker*, with the blocker definition agreed **before** the RC ships so it
cannot be argued down under pressure to tag.

### The pipeline is already ready — this is a process phase, not an engineering one

Verified 2026-08-06 against `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

- The tag trigger is `v*.*.*`, which **does** match `v1.0.0-rc.1`, so an RC tags through the normal
  path with no workflow change.
- **`:latest` is already guarded** — `type=raw,value=latest,enable=${{ !contains(tag, '-') }}`
  (`:148`). A tag containing `-` never becomes `:latest`, so an RC cannot displace the stable image
  for existing users.
- The GitHub release is **automatically marked prerelease** — `*-*) extra_flags="--prerelease"`
  (`:76-79`).

One thing to confirm at the time rather than assume: `docker/metadata-action`'s documented default
is to skip the `{{major}}` and `{{major}}.{{minor}}` tags for prereleases, which is what stops an
RC from overwriting `:1.0` and `:1`. That is the action's behaviour, not something our workflow
states, so **verify it on the first RC tag** before trusting it.

### ⛔ What the RC costs us BEFORE it starts — the part worth planning for now

**The pre-release volatility policy ends the moment an RC reaches a real user.** Today we work
under "pre-release, everything is wipeable": schemas get edited in place, migrations are rewritten
rather than added, and "there are no stored rows to preserve" is a legitimate argument — one used
as recently as #916 this month to justify refusing previously-accepted data.

The instant someone runs an RC against their own library, that argument is gone:

- **Migrations must migrate**, not recreate. No more editing a shipped migration in place.
- **Breaking schema changes need a path**, or a tester loses their work and tells everyone.
- **An RC → GA upgrade must be clean.** If it is not, the RC has taught testers that upgrading is
  dangerous, which is the opposite of what an RC is for.

So the last pre-RC milestone should include a deliberate **"stop being volatile"** step: freeze the
migration history, and state the upgrade promise the RC is making. Do not discover this on the day.

### What has to exist before we ask anyone to test

- **A way to run it.** Testers need their **own** instance with their **own** work — the public
  demo is read-only and proves nothing about migrations, scale, or their formats. Native packages
  (`.deb`/`.rpm`, static binaries, Homebrew) are already a v1.0.0 target and the RC is exactly what
  they are for; if they slip, the RC is Docker-only and we should say so up front.
- **A reporting channel that reaches us**, sized for people who are doing us a favour. A GitHub
  issue template is the durable path; Discord already exists and is where a tester will actually
  say "this looked wrong". Both, with the Discord thread triaged into issues rather than treated as
  the record.
- **A stated scope for testing.** "Find bugs" produces nothing. Ask for specific journeys —
  ingest your real library, run a review session, share with a colleague, upgrade to the next RC.
- **A feature freeze.** New features during an RC invalidate the testing already done. Bug fixes
  and RC-reported regressions only; anything else waits for v1.1.0.

### Why this is worth doing rather than tagging straight to GA

Everything we have tested so far, we tested. The seeded catalogue is ours, the formats are ours,
the workflows are the ones we thought of. An RC is the first contact with libraries we did not
curate, hardware we do not own, and people who will do things in an order we did not anticipate —
which is precisely the class of bug that no amount of internal verification finds.



- **v0.3.1 — foundation cleanup** (shipped 2026-07-17): admin read-cap UI
  (#385), `gofmt` CI gate, `make release`, dependabot split, steel token.
- **v0.4.0 — operator visibility: Jobs + Storage** (shipped 2026-07-18):
  Jobs admin epic #384 complete (queue / workers / live / failed / kinds /
  schedules behind `system.jobs.read`, with requeue, cancel, and concurrency
  edits behind `system.admin`), storage usage + variants
  (`system.storage.read`), and integrity sweeps — orphan scan + checksum
  verification as batched job kinds (ADR 0062).
- **v0.4.1 — dissolved** (2026-07-19). It was overtaken: `dev` already carried
  v0.5.0 feature work, so a "patch" tag containing a new authorization model
  was incoherent, and there is no hotfix-branch practice to cut one from the
  v0.4.0 tag. The `schema.sql` drift (#420) shipped; the storage remainder
  (#419 destructive orphan cleanup, #412 variant drill-down, #408 jobs live
  concurrency reload, plus duplicates / reimport / backends config and the
  RS-parity extensions) moved to **v0.6.0** under #22.
- **v0.5.0 — public mode: anonymous browsing** (epic #413) — **shipped
  2026-07-20.** Content is reachable without an account, behind an operator
  toggle that defaults off. Visibility has one enforcement point (ADR 0063);
  sensitivity gates content, not rows (ADR 0064); the featured rail runs on a
  placement model (ADR 0065); audit IPs are gated behind a dedicated
  capability. Opening the surface exposed and closed three pre-existing access
  holes (#447, #449, #438). Deferred, tracked: #458, #460, #462.
> **On the milestones past v0.6.0:** every open issue is assigned to a version in
> **dependency order** — nothing sits in a milestone that depends on a later one. The
> *sizes* are provisional: several later milestones currently hold more epics than a
> single release has ever shipped, and each gets a scope-cut when it is actually planned
> (grounded in the code as it is then), the way v0.6.0 was. Treat v0.7.0+ as an ordered
> backlog, not a promise of one release each.

- **v0.6.0 — scheduled-action engine + audit completion** (foundation slice,
  scope-cut 2026-07-21). The greenfield **scheduled-action engine** (#40 — embargo
  auto-lift, reveal-with-logging, the executor #44/#51/#52-retention all depend on),
  **audit-log completion** (#52 — retention + signed export; the core shipped with
  #425), and the visibility-cleanup tail (#451, #458, #460, #212) plus #431. Licensing
  (#27), observability (#53), storage tooling (#22) and the privacy switch (#426)
  deferred out of v0.6.0 — each is its own large build. *(Their later homes have
  since moved; see the release-train table above, which is authoritative.)*
- **v0.7.0 — Operator config + browse polish.** *Corrected 2026-07-26.* This line
  previously read "Content config & Integrations (#21 + external imports #55)",
  which contradicted the rebalanced release train above and was the sole reason
  **#21** (Phase 1.18 — Integrations) sat in v0.7.0 at all. **#21 moved to
  v0.12.0** (Platform & extensibility — OAuth apps, webhooks and integrations are
  extensibility surfaces) and **#22** (Phase 1.19 — Storage tooling) **to
  v0.11.0**. Both are multi-release builds that were never sized for v0.7.0; they
  inherited the milestone from this stale prose rather than from a decision.
- **v1.0.0 — GA:** i18n (#289) + native distribution — `.deb`/`.rpm`,
  static binaries, Homebrew (#286).

Product-feature epics (the review-tool arc, AI creative editing,
commerce, physical-archive mode, MCP server/client, external imports,
and the rest) are a **parallel track** tracked as un-milestoned epics —
they interleave with the admin spine rather than blocking it.

## In flight

These have foundations in place; the rest of the surface area is the
current focus:

- **Image processing pipeline** (Phase 1.18.A — shipped). Variant
  generation (col / preview / screen / hires), thumbhash placeholders,
  content-addressed cache headers, generic background-job queue with
  in-process workers + HTTP claim API for external farms /
  federated peers.
- **Video pipeline + animator review player** (Phase 1.18.B). The
  load-bearing UX: a SyncSketch / Keyframe-Pro-2 replacement built
  into the post modal. See "Review tool" arc below for the full
  feature plan.
- **AI arc** (Phase 1.14). The AI inference subsystem is shipped:
  multi-provider abstraction + router + jobs + admin surface
  (1.14.A, PR #149), asset/AI bridge layer + tag provenance
  (1.14.A-bridge, PR #150), CLIP embeddings + pgvector similarity
  (1.14.B, PR #151), Whisper transcription + subtitle integration
  (1.14.C, PR #152), and the first internal MCP caller — img2img
  via the ComfyUI MCP bridge (1.14.E-1, PR #156). **AI auto-tagging
  itself remains in-flight** (issue #18): the inference + provenance
  scaffolding is there, but the upload-time tag inference call is
  not yet wired. Reverse-image search runs against the 1.14.B CLIP
  embeddings today. Next AI sub-phases: 1.14.D (bridge consumption
  cleanup), 1.14.E-2 (full Creative tools panel + mask UI + four
  remaining ops), 1.14.F (caption persistence).

- **Upload-side metadata extraction** (Phase 1.18.A-2 / 1.18.A-3 —
  shipped 2026-06-22 → 2026-06-26). Every uploaded image now extracts
  EXIF (1.18.A-2, PR #158), preserves the ICC chunk through the
  variant pipeline, applies EXIF orientation at variant-render time
  (source bytes pristine), and per-user dedups via a partial unique
  index (PR-A, PR #159). Operators wire extraction config per
  field-definition via an admin picker, review failures in a paginated
  queue, and trigger backfill against existing photos through the
  admin UI (1.18.A-2 PR-B, PR #160). 1.18.A-3 (PR #166) added IPTC
  + XMP extractors against the existing extractor interface. **HEIC
  remains deliberately unsupported** (only pure-Go HEIF reader pulls
  libde265 via CGo; vetoed by the no-CGo guardrail; tracked as
  capability add-on per ADR 0034). Remaining: 1.18.A-3.B (raw camera
  embedded thumbs CR2/NEF/ARW/DNG + PDF page count + title/author),
  1.18.A-4 (video thumbnail at configurable timecode).

- **Account lifecycle** (Phase 1.19 — arc COMPLETE 2026-06-23 →
  2026-07-04). AA can now accept a public user without admin
  handholding, with auth hardening against username enumeration.
  Five PRs landed:
  - **1.19.A-1** (PR #161): email substrate with SMTP-at-rest +
    template library + test-mode capture
  - **1.19.A-2** (PR #162): admin impersonation with
    capability-intersected effective caps + always-visible banner
    + audit recording both actor IDs
  - **1.19.B** (PR #163): self-service TOTP 2FA with enrollment +
    login gate + recovery codes
  - **1.19.C** (PR #164): self-registration + email verification +
    admin approval queue with email-enumeration-safe responses
  - **1.19.D** (PR #198): per-username account lockout — closes
    the original 1.19.B deferral. Migration 00025 adds
    `user.failed_login_count` + `user.lockout_until` + `auth.unlock`
    capability. Race-safe atomic UPDATE-with-CASE (N=10-goroutine
    test verifies exactly-threshold-many increments before
    lockout). Anti-enumeration invariant proven: locked path runs
    bcrypt against dummy password so response timing matches
    wrong-password; 401 shape identical. Composes with existing
    per-IP + per-username rate limits (429 for rate, 401 for
    lockout — distinct failure modes protect against different
    threats). Admin unlock via `POST /admin/users/{ref}/unlock-account`
    with `auth.unlock` capability. IP-subnet-hash audit
    (HMAC-SHA256 salted with ScrambleKey; /24 IPv4, /56 IPv6) —
    threat class without per-request IP log. Federation-safe:
    per-instance state, never federates. Closes issue #171.
  See ADR 0054. No SMS / no email-OTP fallback in v1 — TOTP only.
  Follow-ups explicitly declined per 1.19.D handoff: per-team
  lockout policies (global sysconfig sufficient), password-change
  auto-clear (threat-model gap), email notification on lockout
  (anti-enumeration), bulk unlock UI (rare action), CAPTCHA
  integration (separate arc), full per-request IP audit log
  (subnet hash is intentional).

- **IIIF interoperability** (Phase 1.54 — arc shipped 2026-06-25 →
  2026-07-03). See ADR 0053.
  - **1.54.A** (PR #165): IIIF Image API 3.0 Level 0 over the
    existing variant pipeline. Manifest endpoints (`info.json`),
    region / size / rotation / format / quality parameters,
    content-hash-keyed tile cache, anonymous `iiif.read` capability
    gated on existing visibility, `/admin/iiif/health` per the
    generic subsystem-health pattern. Tile cache is content-
    addressable forever; no persisted derivatives.
  - **1.54.B** (PR #187): Presentation API 3.0 collection + asset
    manifests at `/iiif/3/{kind}/{id}/manifest.json`; navPlace
    geo-tag extension for GPS-tagged assets; embargo-stub manifests
    per ADR 0020; Content Search 2.0 at `/iiif/3/{kind}/{id}/search`
    (asset-scope substring-scans metadata pairs; collection-scope
    dispatches through the 1.16.B `search.Engine` filtered to pinned
    members); 2.0→3.0 URL redirect at `/iiif/2/...` (301, `full`→
    `max` size grammar); federated canvas resolver (5-min in-process
    cache, outside `app/internal/federation/` per soak rule); IIIF
    subsystem card on `/admin/search/dashboard`; Playwright
    structural smoke. Closes issue #170.
  - **1.54.C** (PR #194): External URL alias — Go dual-mount at
    root (in addition to existing `/api/v1/iiif/*` mount). Fixes a
    pre-existing 1.54.A URL emit/mount mismatch where handlers
    emitted `/iiif/3/...` but were only reachable at
    `/api/v1/iiif/3/...`. Nginx-rewrite path was tried first but
    failed CI because `ui-pr.yml` runs embed_web app image
    standalone with no nginx (belt-and-braces: works for both
    standalone and nginx-fronted deployments). Closes issue #188.
  - **1.54.D** (PR #195): Automated Mirador dogfood via Playwright
    on the self-hosted nightly runner —
    `scripts/dogfood/ui/tests/standalone/ui-13-iiif-mirador-dogfood.spec.ts`
    with 3 structural-DOM assertions (Mirador manifest render,
    metadata sidebar populated, Content Search 2.0 endpoint returns
    hits) against a seeded mixed-format fixture collection (2 JPEGs
    + 1 PNG + 1 PDF, one JPEG carrying GPS EXIF for navPlace).
    Mirador via unpkg.com CDN at nightly-only cadence. Screenshot
    artifacts retained 30 days for operator post-hoc review (~2 min
    per merge, down from ~30 min manual dogfood). **Two real
    1.54.B / 1.54.C bugs surfaced and fixed as unblocking
    carve-outs**: Canvas missing required `width`/`height` per
    Presentation 3.0 §5.7 (Mirador crashed on `null.getValue`;
    default 1200×900 landscape placeholder), and Vite dev proxy
    didn't cover `/iiif` alongside `/api` (with `changeOrigin: false`
    so `publicBaseURL(r)` sees original Host). **IIIF arc
    code-complete.** Issue #193 closes on three consecutive green
    nightly runs after merge (first green banked from
    workflow_dispatch on the feature branch; scheduled nightly at
    07:00 UTC provides the remaining two). Follow-ups filed:
    **1.54.E** per-page PDF tile routing, **1.54.F** Content Search
    per-line text extraction (asset_text FTS table), **1.54.G**
    Custom Provider block sysconfig UI, **1.54.H** Content Search
    AnnotationCollection pagination, plus two 1.54.D carve-out
    follow-ups: real image dimensions into `EntityRef.Width/Height`,
    Vite `changeOrigin: false` regression guard.

- **Edit-safety** (Phase 1.16 — partial; shipped 2026-06-26).
  Optimistic-concurrency edit-safety on `PATCH /assets/{id}` +
  `PATCH /collections/{id}` + `PATCH /posts/{id}` (PR #167) using
  `If-Unmodified-Since` headers against the entity's `updated_at`
  timestamp; 409 Conflict with full current-state body on stale
  writes; frontend modals capture baseline + surface 409 with
  explicit "overwrite" action. Lock-free, federation-safe. See ADR
  0052. Resource locking, batch multi-asset metadata edit, and
  custom per-resource ACL remain for follow-ups within the 1.16
  bracket.

- **Search arc** (Phase 1.16.B — shipped 2026-07-01 → 2026-07-02
  across five sub-phases). Unified `/search` endpoint over Postgres
  tsvector with field weighting, DSL parser with strict whitelist,
  cross-package `visibility.Filter` package, pgvector hybrid
  ranking, LISTEN/NOTIFY cache invalidation, saved-searches with
  delta detection + digest emails, admin reindex + observability
  surface. See ADR 0056. Sub-phase ship list:
  - **1.16.B-1** (PR #174): foundation — unified endpoint + BM25-
    shaped ranking + tsvector expansion + cursor pagination +
    LISTEN/NOTIFY-broadcast `QueryResultCache` + `/admin/search/health`
  - **1.16.B-2** (PR #176): facets + advanced DSL + autocomplete
    (`pg_trgm`) + weighted-tsvector retrofit + `visibility` package
  - **1.16.B-3** (PR #178): vector search — `similar_to:<uuid>`
    compile + Engine hybrid ranking + `POST /search/by-image`
    reserved 501 (unblocked by 1.16.B-3-followup below)
  - **1.16.B-3-followup** (PR #199, 2026-07-05): CLIP visual
    encoder sidecar + reverse image search activation.
    `tools/aa-clip-visual-local/` — Python 3.12 + FastAPI +
    OpenCLIP ViT-L/14 OpenAI checkpoint (768-dim, ~2 GB fat image
    with baked checkpoint, Docker Compose profile `visual-search`).
    Migration 00026 adds `asset_visual_embedding` table with
    `vector(768)` + HNSW cosine index (m=16, ef_construction=64),
    **deliberately separate from `asset_embedding_d768`** — two
    embedding spaces (text via Ollama nomic-embed-text, visual via
    CLIP ViT-L/14) with zero cross-comparison. `POST /search/by-image`
    handler flips from 501 stub to 200 when the visual provider
    is registered; nil-provider preserves 501 byte-for-byte. Sysconfig
    `search.visual.{enabled,sidecar_url,timeout_ms,max_upload_bytes,rate_limit_per_user_per_minute,auto_embed_on_upload}`.
    Provider bootstrap probes `/health` at boot; refuses registration
    on dim mismatch (guards against wrong-model swaps corrupting
    the vector column). Coarse MVP visibility floor (anon = public
    only; auth = row-level downstream; consolidation with
    `visibility.Filter` tracked at #185). Closes issue #183.
    Follow-ups filed as separate issues (#200–#204 range).
  - **1.16.B-3-followup-4** (PR #205, 2026-07-05): Admin visual-
    embedding backfill trigger. Migration 00027 adds
    `search_visual_backfill_run` table with partial UNIQUE INDEX
    enforcing single-active-run at DB layer (23505 → HTTP 409).
    New `app/internal/search/vector/visualbackfill/` package
    (Store + Job + Handler) mirrors 1.16.B-5 reindex shape
    verbatim minus the `target` column. Coordinator loop with
    per-batch cancel probe, rate-limited via `golang.org/x/time/rate`,
    typed transient-vs-permanent error classification (only
    `ErrSidecarUnreachable` retries; decode/dim-mismatch/missing-
    hash → failed without abort). Fail-fast 503 when provider
    unregistered (prevents polluting history table). 3 new sysconfig
    knobs (`BackfillBatchSize=100`, `BackfillRateLimitPerSecond=5.0`,
    `BackfillTransientRetryCount=1`); 3 new health gauges
    (`visual_backfill_active`, `visual_embedding_backlog`,
    `visual_embedding_total`). Frontend
    `/admin/search/visual-backfill/+page.svelte` (backlog/coverage/
    total tiles + Start-503-aware + progress bar + Cancel + recent-
    runs table) + `/admin/search/dashboard` live Visual search tile
    replaces pre-followup "By-image (reserved)" placeholder.
    Closes issue #200; partially subsumes #203.
  - **1.16.B-3-followup-2** (PR #206, 2026-07-06): Async
    visualembed upload-hook job. New
    `app/internal/search/vector/visualembed/` package with
    atomic-based Counter (6 keys: success / transient_failed /
    permanent_failed / rate_limited_wait / skipped / pending),
    `JobTypeVisualEmbed` handler that delegates retry entirely to
    the jobs framework (`*jobs.TerminalError` for permanent, plain
    error for transient — mirrors 1.14.B `ai.embed` shape verbatim
    rather than in-handler retry loop, per pre-audit Q3), and
    `Dispatcher` with guard chain (provider registered → sysconfig
    auto_embed enabled → asset extension is image → Jobs) called
    immediately after the `ai.embed` enqueue in the CreateAsset
    fanout. 2 new sysconfig knobs (`AutoEmbedRateLimitPerSecond=5.0`,
    `AutoEmbedRetryCount=2`). Process-shared rate limiter with 5s
    wait timeout — bulk uploads queue-and-smooth rather than
    fail-then-retry; rate-limit-wait time metered as its own
    counter key. Dedicated counter avoids ballooning search-query
    p95/p99 (embed durations 100–500ms would swamp shared
    percentile window). Deterministic idempotency key
    (`search.visual_embed|<asset_id>`) prevents federation-replay
    or upload-retry double-enqueue. Silent skip on guard failure
    (non-image uploads are common in mixed corpora — skip counter
    surfaces volume without log flood). Runtime-toggleable via
    sysconfig (no restart). Deferred: dedicated duration histogram
    (#207). **Reverse-image search coverage now complete —
    existing corpus via backfill, new uploads via auto-embed.**
    Closes issue #201; #183 arc fully wrapped.
  - **1.16.B-4** (PR #180): saved searches + delta detection +
    email-on-match via the 1.19.A-1 substrate + digest coordinator
  - **1.16.B-5** (PR #182): admin reindex tooling + disk-usage view
    + saved-search admin + full `/admin/search/dashboard` +
    federation-inbox embed hook (out-of-tree). Issue #168 closed;
    ADR 0056 accepted.
  - **1.16.B-5-followup** (PR #208, 2026-07-06): Search feedback
    loop — thumbs up/down on results + admin aggregation.
    Migration 00028 adds `search_feedback` table with
    `UNIQUE (user_ref, hit_asset_id, query_hash)` enforcing
    vote-flipping via `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` + CHECK constraints
    (direction ∈ 'up' or 'down', hit_position ≥ 1) + 4 supporting
    indexes. New `app/internal/search/feedback/` package: SHA-256
    query hash over trim + collapse-whitespace + lowercase
    canonical form (documented as NOT full AST canonicalization —
    `cat AND dog` still distinct from `dog AND cat`); hand-written
    SQL store matching reindex/visualbackfill/visualembed pattern;
    disabled → visibility → rate-limit → upsert gate chain;
    `PoolVisibility` (exists + non-deleted; enumeration-safe
    conflation with `hit_not_visible` — attacker can't probe UUIDs
    via feedback). `POST /search/feedback` + `DELETE /search/feedback/{id}`
    require authenticated user (401 anonymous); rate-limited via
    `SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE user_ref = $1 AND feedback_at > NOW() -
    INTERVAL '24 hours'` — undo (DELETE) refunds the token
    naturally by lowering the count; no separate refund
    bookkeeping; survives restarts. `GET /admin/search/feedback`
    anonymized aggregation (top down-voted queries + under-ranked
    hits; both use `latest_dsl` CTE for display-form DSL per
    `query_hash`). `GET /admin/search/feedback/audit/{user_ref}`
    per-user abuse-review log; access fires
    `admin.search.feedback.audit_viewed` audit event recording
    both actor + subject. Anonymized-by-default aggregation
    (per-user log is behind a distinct URL that requires typing
    ref explicitly AND fires audit). Frontend
    `ThumbButtons.svelte` with optimistic UI (updates locally,
    POSTs in background, reverts on error) + 300ms debounce +
    5s undo-toast firing DELETE + a11y (`aria-pressed`, labels) +
    hides entirely when unauthenticated. 3 sysconfig knobs
    (`Enabled *bool` pointer semantic so fresh installs default
    true, `MaxPerUserPerDay=60`, `AggregationWindowDays=7`),
    range-validated. `auth.IPSubnetHash` exported with a `domain`
    argument (HMAC-SHA256 salted with ScrambleKey; /24 IPv4,
    /56 IPv6) — 1.19.D lockout path delegates to the shared
    implementation; domain prefix prevents cross-subsystem hash
    collision on rotated salts. 5 new `search.Counter` Result
    classes (`search_feedback_up`, `_down`, `_undo`, `_rate_limit`, `_disabled`)
    + `AsFeedbackCounter` adapter mirroring the saved-search
    pattern. New `search_feedback_active_voters` gauge (DISTINCT
    user count in aggregation window) on `/admin/search/health`.
    New Feedback tile on `/admin/search/dashboard` groups the 5
    Result classes + active_voters gauge; nav link. Query cache
    NOT invalidated on feedback events (load-bearing decision —
    feedback is out-of-band signal, results stay stable for the
    60s cache TTL). Per-instance state — never federates. Runtime-
    toggleable via sysconfig (no restart). Signal for future ADR
    0055 pg_search revisit — structured data on 'which queries
    surface bad results' instead of vibes. Deferred: dedicated
    duration histogram (would pollute the shared search.Counter
    latency window — same reasoning as PR #206); split
    `search.Counter.RecordEvent` vs `RecordLatency` (#209).
    **Closes issue #184.**
  - **1.16.B-followup** (PR #213, 2026-07-06): `visibility.Filter`
    retrofit. Scope-trimmed after pre-audit. The follow-up brief
    described four surfaces duplicating the shared check (list
    handlers, IIIF gate, by-image floor, feedback PoolVisibility).
    Pre-audit found ONE genuine duplicate (feedback) plus three
    surfaces with distinct semantic shapes that would require
    speculative API additions to unify: IIIF is field-level
    metadata gating not row-level; by-image uses a `sensitivity`
    column that `visibility.Filter(EntityAsset)` does not touch;
    list handlers are sqlc-static queries with no dynamic
    visibility fragments to consolidate. Shipped the honest scope:
    new `visibility.CanSee` helper that composes the shared
    Predicate into an EXISTS-shaped query byte-for-byte matching
    the pre-retrofit inline SQL feedback used. `feedback.PoolVisibility`
    swapped to call the helper. Enumeration-safe collapse of
    `not-visible` and `not-exists` into 403 `hit_not_visible`
    survives verbatim (all 11 snapshot-test error-body assertions
    preserved). ADR 0056 §4 updated. Follow-ups filed for the three
    deferred sub-scopes: sensitivity semantics for by-image (#210);
    a FieldVisibility API for IIIF (#211); sqlc migration for list
    handlers (#212). **Closes issue #185.**
  - **1.16.B-followup-2** (PR #215, 2026-07-06): shared
    `AdminBackfillPanel.svelte` extraction — closes #186. Pure
    frontend refactor consolidating three admin backfill surfaces
    that shipped their UX shell independently across PRs #160
    (metadata extraction), #182 (search reindex), and #205
    (visual-embedding backfill). Component lives at
    `web/src/lib/components/admin/AdminBackfillPanel.svelte`,
    props-driven and API-agnostic — parents own fetch, component
    consumes `onStart` / `onRefresh` / `onCancel` callbacks. Every
    subsystem divergence expressed via Svelte 5 snippets or optional
    props (no `if page === X` branches inside): `controls` snippet
    for the per-subsystem form (metadata: asset-type + file-ext +
    include-non-image; reindex: scope + target picker; visual: none);
    `gauges` snippet for the backlog/embedded/coverage tiles
    (visual only today); `extraColumnHeaders` + `extraRowCells`
    snippets for extra columns before Processed (metadata: Scope;
    reindex: Scope + Target); `extraColumnHeadersAfterFailed` +
    `extraRowCellsAfterFailed` for extras after Failed (visual:
    Progress); `startDisabledReason` prop generalises visual's
    503-when-sidecar-not-registered gate; `disableStartWhenActive`
    prop lets metadata queue runs while another is active (per its
    existing behaviour). Vitest snapshot suite committed FIRST as
    16-cell compliance baseline (subsystem × state matrix + 503
    gate), running green on every subsequent commit. Vitest
    semantic unit tests cover Start-disabled tooltip, Cancel
    callback + confirm gate, empty-state colspan math across snippet
    counts, status-badge classification for running/done/failed/
    cancelled. Live Playwright smoke on all three admin pages
    confirmed identical column headers + button labels + gauge
    values pre/post-refactor. Vitest config extended with
    `resolve.conditions: ['browser']` so Svelte 5 + Testing Library
    components can render (previously only pure `.svelte.ts` helper
    tests existed; this is the first component-render test path).
    Zero backend / API / sysconfig / migration changes.
    **Closes issue #186.**
  - **1.16.B-followup-3** (PR #217, 2026-07-07): `search.Counter`
    split — closes #209. Cheap 30-min hygiene refactor identified
    during PR #208. Split the shared `search.Counter.Record(class,
    duration)` into `RecordLatency(class, duration)` (semantics
    unchanged; real request timings) and `RecordEvent(class)`
    (new; increments `requests[class]` only — never touches the
    latency window). Twelve event-only callers migrated to
    `RecordEvent` (five in `AsFeedbackCounter` adapter + seven in
    `AsSavedSearchCounter` adapter); seven latency callers moved
    to `RecordLatency` (main `/search` handler + six sites in
    `by_image.go`). Prior conflation caused zero-value observations
    from event-only paths to dilute p50/p95/p99 percentile
    reporting. Clean break per no-backcompat-shims memory — no
    `Record` shim; grep proof `.Record(Result` empty across
    `app/internal/search/`. Zero observable change from
    `/admin/search/health` (response shape unchanged; percentiles
    now reflect real query timings). Three new unit tests protect
    the invariant. Also fixed pre-existing v2.7.1 → v2.7.2
    oapi-codegen version-comment drift on `dev` that had been
    silently blocking the Codegen drift check on every PR.
    **Closes issue #209.**
  Follow-ups filed: #210 sensitivity semantics for
  `visibility.Filter(EntityAsset)`; #211 `FieldVisibility` API for
  IIIF metadata gating; #212 sqlc migration path for list handlers;
  #214 MDX braced-identifier CI gate on docs PRs; #216
  `.pnpm-store` gitignore + docs-build hygiene; #218 pin
  oapi-codegen version explicitly in `scripts/generate.sh`.
  **1.16.B search arc fully closed** — 5 sub-phases plus 6
  followups shipped end-to-end.

## Review tool — the load-bearing UX arc

The post modal is becoming the animator's review tool. Phase 1.18.B
ships in sub-phases so each piece can be tested against real review
sessions before the next lands.

### 1.18.B-1 — Video pipeline (shipped)
- ffmpeg-based preview.video handler: probe → poster → HLS adaptive
  ladder (480p / 720p / 1080p) → 100-cell sprite sheet + WebVTT.
- Encoder detection at boot: probes ffmpeg `-encoders` AND verifies
  each candidate with a 4-frame synthetic encode. Picks NVENC > QSV
  > VideoToolbox > libx264. Falls back gracefully on any failure.
- Wildcard chi route for multi-segment HLS variant keys.
- `<video>` element with HLS.js (native HLS on Safari). HUD with
  HH:MM:SS:FF timecode + frame counter via
  `requestVideoFrameCallback`. JKL transport, ±1 / ±10 frame step
  (arrows + comma/period + Shift), I/O loop region, 1-5 speed
  presets, sticky muted-autoplay + persistent volume via
  localStorage, sprite hover preview on the scrubber.
- Mounted in the post carousel directly (no extra Review-mode click).

### 1.18.B-2 — Player polish + quality-of-life (in flight)
- Click-to-pause on the video canvas; click-and-drag scrub on the
  HUD timecode.
- Fullscreen button + `F` shortcut; always-on-top (PiP) when the
  browser allows.
- Jump-to-frame input + jump-to-timecode parser.
- Pan + zoom on the video frame (mouse wheel + drag) — pixel-perfect
  inspection without leaving playback.
- Flip + rotate (H / V / 90°).
- Ping-pong loop, hold-frame at IN/OUT, range bookmarks.
- Frame bookmarks (single + range) with cycle hotkeys.
- Audio scrub (variable-speed) while dragging the playhead.
- Screen capture to clipboard / file.

### 1.18.B-3 — Subtitles + multi-format captions (shipped)
**Shipped via PR #137 (`5d16dcb`).** ui-nightly green at 10m21s on 2026-06-16.
- Native WebVTT track support (`<track>` elements) wired into the existing VideoPlayer.
- Pure-Go worker-side conversion of SRT / SSA / ASS / SUB → WebVTT; IDX deferred to a capability add-on per ADR 0034.
- Sidecar auto-detection on multi-file asset ingest (`clip.mp4` + `clip.en.srt` pattern).
- Burned-subtitle export via the existing worker queue.
- Per-user subtitle preferences (enabled / preferredLang / fontSize / position).
- Dedicated `asset_subtitle_tracks` table — tracks bound to assets via FK + CASCADE; NOT counted in asset-count queries; only applicable to audio/video assets (422 guard).
- First post-baseline migration under ADR 0046's append-only convention; sets the `0000N_description.sql` convention going forward.

### 1.18.B-4 — Image sequences + RAM cache + always-on-top
- Treat an image-sequence asset (numbered PNG/EXR/JPEG run) as a
  first-class playable timeline.
- Client-side RAM cache: pre-decoded frame buffer for instant scrub
  on short clips.
- "Always on top" window mode (browser PiP / SPA detached window).

### 1.18.B-5 — Presentation rooms (global, real-time)
Presentation is a global capability — image, video, 3D, PDF, any
asset that can be shown. The player / viewer is a host; the
"presentation room" is a separate concern that wraps any host.

- WebSocket presence room keyed on `(post_id or asset_id)`: live
  cursor, live scrub position, who's watching.
- Synchronous mode: a presenter drives the playhead / camera /
  page. Observers follow. Offline = solo (default).
- Shared chat + reactions alongside whatever's being shown.
- Mobile + tablet observers via the same UI.
- The protocol is asset-type-agnostic: a frame number, a 3D camera
  matrix, a PDF page index — all "anchor" objects the host sends
  on each tick. Observers' viewers replay them.

### 1.18.B-6 — Annotation system (global, frame/anchor-aware)
Annotations are a global capability too — they live in their own
package and any asset host (image, video, 3D, PDF) surfaces them.
Extends to **PDF page annotations**: anchored to `(asset_id, page,
x, y, w, h)`; rendered against the PDF raster preview; exported in
the PDF summary with comment thread + screenshots per anchor. Clean-room
Svelte implementation of pen / highlighter / arrow / text / eraser
tools.

- Anchor model: an annotation binds to an asset_id PLUS an
  asset-type-specific anchor — a frame number for video, a
  camera+target for 3D, a page+x/y for PDF, a coord+zoom for
  images. The same `annotations` table stores them all; the host
  package owns rendering.
- Brush engine: pen, highlighter, eraser, shapes, text, arrows.
- Foreground + background layers; background transparency.
- Laser pointer for live review (broadcasts via the presentation
  room when one is active).
- Ghosting / onion-skin between adjacent anchors (video frames,
  3D camera takes, PDF pages).
- Annotation bookmarks; cycle hotkeys.
- PDF summary export with comment thread + screenshots per anchor.

### Architecture note — how the global systems connect
The three layers stay separate so each evolves independently:

1. **Host viewers** — `ImageReview`, `VideoPlayer`, `ModelViewer`,
   `PDFViewer`, etc. Each owns its surface (pan/zoom, scrub, camera,
   page). All emit + accept a typed "anchor" describing where we
   are.
2. **Annotation overlay** — a single Svelte component layered on
   top of any host. Reads + writes anchor-tagged annotations via
   the shared `/assets/{id}/annotations` API. Doesn't know about
   the host beyond the anchor schema.
3. **Presentation room** — a separate WebSocket-backed store that
   broadcasts the current anchor + cursor + chat. Any host can
   listen to it (slave its anchor to the presenter) and emit to it
   (when this user is the presenter).

Concretely: VideoPlayer emits `{type:"video", frame:N}` anchors;
ModelViewer emits `{type:"model", camera:[...], target:[...]}`;
PDFViewer emits `{type:"pdf", page:N, x, y, zoom}`. Annotations are
indexed by `(asset_id, anchor_hash)`. Presentation rooms forward
whatever anchor the presenter emits to everyone in the room.

### 1.18.B-7 — Timeline assembly
- Build a review timeline from multiple source files (different
  takes, different shots).
- Per-source in / out points, ordering, audio override.
- Seamless playback between sources.
- Export the assembled timeline as a standalone media file (ffmpeg).

### 1.18.B-8 — A/B comparison
- Split viewer (horizontal / vertical / grid).
- A/B wipe with draggable seam.
- A/B transparency / overlay blend.
- Pair any two assets — different versions, reference footage.

### 1.18.B-9 — DCC integrations
- Python client API for external tools to drive the player
  (open, seek, annotate, snapshot).
- Maya → review send-back script.
- Blender / Houdini integrations (community-driven via the same API).
- Webhook + presence broadcasts for studio production trackers.

### 1.18.B-10 — 3D viewer (native) — SHIPPED, with corrections
- ~~`<model-viewer>` for glTF / GLB native~~ — **not what shipped.** The
  viewer uses the three.js loaders directly (`GLTFLoader` / `FBXLoader` /
  `OBJLoader` + `MTLLoader`) in `ModelView.svelte`; there is no
  `<model-viewer>` dependency. *(Corrected 2026-07-29.)*
- three.js loaders for OBJ (+ .mtl + texture set) and FBX.
- Marmoset Toolbag `.mview` native player (self-contained JS).
- USDZ via Quick Look on Apple devices.
- Camera presets, lighting picker, turntable poster generation,
  wireframe / UV inspect modes.

### 1.18.B-10a — 3D animation arc (epic #741, ADR 0078) — v0.10.0
- **Rig identity extracted at ingest** (#742) — bone-name signature, bone
  list, per-clip name/duration/track-count. The gating item, and the only
  one whose cost grows with the catalogue.
- **Shared-rig clip playback** (#743) — play a clip from one asset on a
  different, rig-compatible mesh. Small: `AnimationMixer` already binds
  tracks to bones by name, so no transformation is involved.
- **Cross-rig retargeting** (#744) — a **spike, not a commitment.**
  `SkeletonUtils.retargetClip` is in no official three.js example and
  carries standing correctness bugs. ADR 0078 keeps retargeting out of the
  supported set, and forbids it as a silent fallback.
- Per ADR 0076 (amended), a playing clip is **time-based media** and reuses
  the existing transport and frame-addressing model — no second player.

### 1.18.B-11 — 3D heavy converters (worker side)
- ~~Blender headless → glTF for `.blend`~~ — **Blender was removed from the
  image entirely** (#500/#680, image 3.64GB → 1.82GB) and is not to be
  packaged again. Proprietary-format conversion was re-scoped to optional
  **plugin** delivery (#499, v0.14.0) per ADR 0069. *(Corrected 2026-07-29.)*
- FBX2glTF for cached glTF when the source format is heavy.
- Maya `.mb` / `.ma` and 3ds Max `.max` — extract embedded preview
  where possible; full conversion gated on a licensed converter
  side-car. Native-viewer-first; convert only on miss.
- Per-format converter run as a separate job type so a render farm
  can pick it up.

### 1.18.B-12 — Audio / SVG / PDF / fonts
- Audio waveform PNG + scrub.
- SVG → rasterized variant set.
- PDF first-page raster + multi-page navigator.
- Font specimen render.

### 1.18.B-13 — Project / workspace
- "Review project" entity: a collection of assets curated for a
  review session, with timelines, annotations, chat history.
- Save / share / fork projects.
- Snapshot a project state for "this is what we showed at the
  Tuesday review".

### 1.18.B-14 — Federation + share-with-anyone
- Public share link with permission scope (view / comment /
  annotate) and optional expiry.
- Federated peer instances surface annotations + chat back to the
  origin instance. The job queue's existing `origin_server_id` +
  the HTTP claim API are the carrier.
- Quick-generate PDF summary for offline clients.

### 1.18.B-15 — Sprite-sheet viewer (shipped)
- Auto-slice by uniform grid (rows × cols, configurable cell size)
  and by edge-detection (find tightest bounding box per visible
  region) — operator picks the strategy per asset.
- Frame index panel with thumbnails; reorder, name, and group
  frames into named action sequences (idle / walk / attack).
- Animation timeline + scrubber that plays the slices in order with
  configurable FPS, ping-pong, hold-frame, and onion-skin between
  adjacent frames. Reuses the existing video HUD primitives.
- Per-frame metadata persisted as a sidecar companion JSON
  (action ranges, per-frame notes, slices, alt-files /
  palette-swap previews). The anchor-tagged annotation integration
  with 1.18.B-6 is deferred — the companion format is forward-
  compatible so a later commit can rewire it into the shared
  annotation surface without re-tagging existing data.
- Export individual cels as PNG / WebP, or export the action set
  as a packed sprite sheet (PNG + JSON) or a per-frame zip; a
  client-side GIF encoder lets the browser produce share-ready
  animations without a server round-trip.

### 1.18.B-16 — Texture inspector
- Channel splitter: view R / G / B / A as separate greyscale views,
  or as a packed-channel overlay (e.g., R = roughness, G = metallic,
  B = ambient occlusion — the convention surfaces in the inspector
  UI so reviewers don't have to guess).
- Linear ↔ sRGB toggle for accurate color-managed review of
  source textures vs runtime appearance.
- Normal map preview with light-source rotation; tangent-space
  validation (is this normal map decoded the way you think it is?).
- Mip-chain preview: scroll through pre-computed mip levels at the
  size they'll appear in-engine. Catch mip-popping problems before
  ship.
- Alpha channel mode: solid / checkerboard / outline overlay so
  reviewers can see transparency cleanly.
- File-format awareness: BC1 / BC3 / BC5 / BC7 / ASTC / ETC2
  decoders so the inspector shows what the engine actually
  sees, not just what Photoshop saved.

### 1.18.B-17 — Color & palette inspector
- Eyedropper with hex / RGB / HSL / OKLCH readout; copy to
  clipboard in any format.
- Dominant-color extraction: top-N palette of any image, with
  share-of-pixels percentages. Useful for "does this character
  match our style palette?" reviews.
- Palette comparison: drop two assets side by side, see their
  extracted palettes overlaid, with delta-E coverage of every
  swatch. Catches style drift between artists.
- Save and name reference palettes per workflow / collection;
  validate any new upload against a reference palette and warn on
  drift beyond a configurable delta-E threshold.

### 1.18.B-18 — Bitmap / format inspector
- Size diff between source and encoded variants: source PNG vs
  BC3 vs BC7 vs ASTC, byte-for-byte and as a percentage. Helps
  optimization reviewers spot regressions.
- Side-by-side encoded preview against the source, with the same
  A/B wipe primitives from 1.18.B-8 so format compression artifacts
  surface visually.
- Alpha-on-color delta view: highlight pixels whose alpha or color
  changed between source and encoded variant, in any user-selectable
  color. Surfaces premultiply / unpremultiply mistakes immediately.
- Per-format metadata badges: compression type, block size, encoder
  used, expected runtime cost. Operators know exactly what they're
  looking at without reading file headers manually.

### 1.18.B-19 — Review queue (auto-rotated)
The "review mode" navbar button (already shipped) opens a system-curated
queue of assets that need review. Reuses the existing AssetViewer +
AssetPlaylist surfaces; no new viewer shell or "review session" toggle —
the navbar button is dedicated enough.

- **Auto-rotated queue.** A scheduled job rolls over to a fresh queue
  on a configurable cadence. Default policy is **opt-in** — operator
  enables auto-rotation in admin settings; absence keeps the queue
  manual / operator-curated. Once enabled, the queue auto-populates
  with assets matching a curation rule (initial impl: "assets created
  since last queue rollover that haven't been reviewed").
- **Last-viewed-item resume.** Per-(user, queue) bookmark of "where
  did I stop reviewing?" Opening the queue resumes at that position;
  no scroll-hunt to find the last spot. Cached per user; invalidated
  on queue rollover.
- **Override viewed status.** Reviewers can manually mark an asset
  as reviewed (advance the queue) OR mark previously-reviewed as
  unreviewed (re-queue it). Per-(user, queue, asset) state.
- **Count badge** on the navbar review button — count of
  not-yet-reviewed items in the current queue for this user.
- **Operator-tunable cadence** via system_config (default daily at
  the operator's site timezone if auto-rotation is enabled).
- Borrowed conceptually from an internal studio pipeline reference
  reviewed under the clean-room rules (ADR 0040); no code lift.
  Departs from that reference on policy: the reference rotates on cron
  unconditionally; AA defaults to opt-in to avoid surprising
  operators who didn't ask for it.
- Per ABC: queue contents cached; invalidated on rollover + on
  review completion + on viewed-status override.
- Per the cadence: soak-safe; no federation runtime involvement.

### Future ideas — from the internal review-mode reference (deferred, not scheduled)

These were surfaced from the internal reference review on 2026-06-18 and
are worth pulling forward when their parent surface lands. Not
scheduled as standalone sub-phases — they fold into adjacent work.

- **Hover info panel + right-click-to-pin** — when hovering a thumbnail
  anywhere (browse feed, playlist, collection view), show a large
  preview + metadata + annotation count. Right-click pins so it stays
  while you keep scrolling — explicit compare affordance. Fold into a
  future viewer/browse polish phase; not review-mode-specific.
- **Annotation count badges on thumbnails** — at-a-glance signal of
  which assets have feedback. Falls out of the annotations work in
  1.18.B-6 once annotations exist; small UI addition then.
- **Fullscreen "Artist View" with deep-link state persistence** — modal
  state survives refresh + can be deep-linked. Fold into AssetViewer
  polish later (extends 1.18.B-2 territory).

Explicitly rejected from the internal reference:
- **Save-and-next batch workflow** — friction point for artists;
  contradicts the minimize-artist-input principle. Artists want one
  page with little input.
- **Strip view of a playlist** — not on the roadmap.
- **Smart metadata field reordering on edit** — fragile UX that
  breaks operator muscle memory.

### 1.18.B-20 — Frame-scoped review annotation (ADR 0076)

Epic #728. The player already unifies video + audio behind one
transport and already addresses frames (1.18.B-1). ADR 0076 records
that and adds the part that is missing: **annotations that belong to a
frame**, not to the asset.

Verified before scoping: `frame_number` / `frameNumber` appear nowhere
in the codebase, so a drawing made while reviewing is not attached to
the moment it describes.

- **#729** — frame-rate trustworthiness gate. An asset whose rate cannot
  be trusted must not present a frame index; a guessed rate silently
  misplaces every annotation stored against it.
- **#730** — frame-scoped annotation storage + API. The only piece with
  no existing backend. The frame rate travels with the annotation, or it
  is unplaceable after a rate correction or a federation hop.
- **#731** — draw on a frame. Wires the existing brush engine
  (`BrushCanvas`, `brushes.ts`) into the player; a review-only drawing
  implementation is explicitly rejected.
- **#732** — annotation markers on the scrubber. What turns a review
  recording into a review *document*. Marker cost is bounded by frame
  count, not annotation count.
- **#733** — adjacent-frame stroke ghosting, so an arc drawn across six
  frames is legible. A view setting; never stored on the annotation.
- **#734** — stacked control rows (transport / drawing / view), fit,
  flip, grid overlay, and comparison as the same player instantiated
  twice against one transport.

Sequencing: 729 → 730 → 731 → 732 → 733, with 734 foldable in after 729.


## Admin settings — fleshing out every placeholder

The admin shell currently has 13 sections; most have a real surface
in place, the rest are intentional stubs so the menu shape is stable.
This is the list of "make every placeholder a real surface" work,
roughly in order of practical value to operators.

### System — extant
- **Site**, **SMTP**, **Auth providers**, **AI providers** — real
  forms, persisted to `system_config`.
- **Appearance / Themes** — palette tokens + font slot picker.

### System — to flesh out
- **Previews** (Phase 1.18.C). Real admin UI for
  `sysconfig.PreviewConfig`: variant sizes, qualities, fit mode,
  default encoder preference (`auto` / `prefer-gpu` / `cpu-only`),
  storage limits, retention.
- **Jobs queue dashboard** (Phase 1.18.D). Live queue depth by
  type + status, recent failures with stack-trace expand, retry /
  cancel / requeue, manual enqueue, worker presence (incl. external
  farms + federated peers), backpressure controls.
- **System log** (Phase 1.20). Real audit-log surface (currently a
  stub). Filterable by actor, action, target, time. Export to CSV.
- **Storage backends** (Phase 1.19). Active backend, switch fs ↔ s3
  without downtime, content-addressed dedupe report, orphan
  cleanup, presigned-URL preview, capacity + cost dashboards.
- **Federation** (Phase 1.22). Peer instance registration, trust
  scopes, outbox / inbox status, conflict resolution.
- **Webhooks** (Phase 1.20). Outbound webhook endpoints, signing
  keys, retry policy, delivery log.
- **Notifications** (Phase 1.20). Notification rules + delivery
  channels (in-app, email, webhook). Rate limits.
- **Backups** (Phase 1.19). Backup destination config, schedule,
  retention, manual snapshot, restore flow.
- **Health probes** (Phase 1.20). Readiness checks per subsystem
  (DB, storage, encoder, federation), self-test buttons.

### Catalog / metadata — extant
- **Fields & metadata** — real list of `field_definitions`.
- **Workflow states** — real list of `workflow_states`. **Read-only** (`GET
  /workflow/states`); there is no mutating endpoint, so `workflow.admin`
  currently gates nothing. See the Workflow editor below.

### Catalog / metadata — to flesh out
- **Fields editor** (Phase 1.16). Create / update / archive fields
  from the UI; reorder; default values per resource type;
  required-on-upload toggle; resource-type scoping; field sets.
- **Workflow editor** (Phase 1.16). Build state machines: define
  states, transitions, required capabilities per transition,
  initial / terminal states, icon + color, requires-note flag.
  **Tracked as epic #897 (v0.12.0)** since 2026-08-04 — this spec sat
  without an issue, the same gap that produced #520. **Read the
  2026-08-04 amendment to [ADR 0010](/adr/0010-permissions-teams-workflow/)
  before starting**: the tables all exist, but
  `workflow.Service.Transition()` has **zero production callers** and
  `state_id` is written raw from client input, so the transition graph
  and its per-transition capabilities are decorative and `workflow_audit`
  is never written by the API. Enforcement is **#896 (v0.10.0)** and
  lands first — #530's review queue depends on it, and an editor for a
  state machine nothing enforces would be a settings page with no effect.
  Open decisions carried on #897: whether workflow state may affect
  visibility at all (the unread `visible_by_default` column proposes that
  it should; ADR 0063/0064 argue against a second row-hiding plane), and
  whether review and availability are one axis or two — ours currently
  mixes them, since `archived`/`deleted` are availability while
  `pending_review` is review. Also #895: the scheduled `change_state`
  action resolves codes in domain `asset` while states are seeded under
  `asset:1`, so its documented code form is dead on every stock install.
- **Resource types** (Phase 1.16). Currently stub. Create resource
  types, attach fields, per-type variant set overrides, per-type
  workflow domain wiring.

### Identity / access — extant
- **Users** — list with role assignment.
- **Roles & capabilities** — read-only list.

### Identity / access
- **Shipped in Phase 1.17** (tracker #20, closed 2026-06-19): the
  admin Users / Roles / Teams surfaces and account token management
  are live (`/admin/users`, `/admin/roles`, `/admin/teams`,
  `/account/tokens`). Residual identity polish rides in the normal
  backlog rather than a phase arc.
- **Audit-log filters** (Phase 1.20). Per-actor, per-action,
  per-target views; export.

### Operations — to add
- **Background jobs** dedicated section (Phase 1.18.D — see above).
- **Migration runner status** (Phase 1.20). Show every applied
  migration + checksum; run pending in maintenance mode.
- **Maintenance mode** (Phase 1.20). Banner + read-only flip,
  scoped exemption list.
- **Feature flags** (Phase 1.21). Sysconfig-backed toggles for
  in-flight features; per-user / per-team overrides.

### Integrations — to flesh out
- **Plugin manager** (Phase 1.23). Install / enable / disable
  plugins; permission grants per plugin; WASM sandbox config.
- **DCC client APIs** (Phase 1.18.B-9). Token + scope management
  for Maya / Blender / etc. clients hitting the review API.

### About / help — to flesh out
- **About**. Build info (commit + tag), license + attributions,
  release notes link, capability matrix.
- **Help & shortcuts**. Searchable doc embedded; full hotkey map
  per area (browse, review, admin).

## Up next

The phases queued behind the current focus, in build order:

- **Pre-MVP cleanup** (Phase 1.49). Foundational debt-clearing for
  the v0.1.0 release. Per [ADR 0046](/adr/0046-migration-baseline-and-squash-policy/),
  pre-MVP migrations MAY be squashed once into a single baseline;
  the append-only-forever trigger resolved to v1.0.0 (ADR 0046,
  2026-07-11, resolves #228).
  Sub-phases:
  - ✅ 1.49.A — PanicShim consolidation (shipped)
  - ✅ 1.49.B — Legacy fallback drop (shipped)
  - ✅ 1.49.C-1 — DB schema audit report (shipped via PR #132;
    [`docs/cleanup-audit-2026-06.md`](https://github.com/Artist-Alley-Org/artist-alley/blob/dev/docs/cleanup-audit-2026-06.md);
    26 findings)
  - ✅ 1.49.C-2 — Migration baseline squash (shipped via PR #135
    `8c4922f`; 14 migrations → 1 baseline at
    [`00001_baseline_v0_1.sql`](https://github.com/Artist-Alley-Org/artist-alley/blob/dev/app/internal/db/migrations/00001_baseline_v0_1.sql);
    all 24 audit-derived edits applied; CI 7/7 green)
  - ✅ 1.49.D — Scrub product references from source (COMPLETE
    2026-07-13: the last comparison in `social/mention/doc.go` plus a
    follow-up real-IP sweep — API examples, ADRs 0007/0008/0010,
    internal-reference naming, seed scripts — closed issue #83)

  Gated the v0.1.0 release tag. Soak-compatible — the audit + the
  squash + the scrub all touch DB schema / docs / source-text only;
  the federation runtime is not affected.

- **Identity & teams** (Phase 1.17). Groups + team hierarchy,
  active session management, capability grants. Extended with: **table-level change tracking** with before / after
  diffs in the audit log (not just event-level), **user approval
  states** (pending / approved / disabled) with admin approval flow,
  **resource request workflow** (user asks for an asset →
  capability-holder approves or denies → notification fires →
  request lifecycle tracked, including auto-expiry).

- **Audit log & change tracking** (Phase 1.40). The central event log
  consolidating the audit-trail story currently scattered across
  Phases 1.17 / 1.20 / 1.21 / 1.24 / 1.26–1.28 / 1.32. Owns the event
  schema (actor + action + target + outcome + changeset before / after
  + metadata + correlation_id + license_kid), the dotted event
  taxonomy (`auth.*` / `user.*` / `asset.*` / `share.*` / `commerce.*`
  / `platform.*` / `system.*` / etc.), the capture API
  (`audit.Record(ctx, ...)` with buffered async writes — failure to
  record never fails the originating operation), the admin filter +
  search + detail + export surface at `/admin/audit`, retention
  policy (default 7 years, per-category overrides at Enterprise,
  enforced via the Phase 1.28 scheduled-action engine), and signed
  Enterprise export (Ed25519 over the JSONL payload, public key at
  `/.well-known/audit-signing-key` per ADR 0017). The
  `correlation_id` field links every event from a single request /
  job so cascade effects are reconstructable. Same features at
  Community + Pro; Enterprise adds the signed export, per-category
  retention overrides, and multi-instance audit-log federation. See
  ADR 0032.

- **Observability & operator telemetry** (Phase 1.41). Production-
  readiness layer: `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint with HTTP / DB /
  job-queue / storage / cache / session / license / federation /
  audit families; OpenTelemetry tracing via OTLP with auto-instrumented
  HTTP / DB / job / external-API spans (10 % sampling default,
  errors 100 %, W3C Trace Context propagation); structured-log
  shipping via opt-in forwarder providers (Loki / Datadog /
  Cloudwatch / Vector / Promtail / syslog); per-subsystem log
  levels hot-reloaded from admin + a `?log_level=debug` per-request
  escape hatch; admin live-tail log viewer at `/admin/logs/tail`
  via WebSocket; pre-baked Grafana dashboards in
  `infra/grafana/dashboards/` for HTTP / job queue / storage /
  federation / license / audit. Health endpoints stay at
  `/healthz` + `/readyz` with detailed per-subsystem status at
  `/admin/system/health`. Same features at Community + Pro; Enterprise
  adds priority ops support, vendor-specific OTLP exporter configs
  (New Relic / Honeycomb / etc.), and an SLA on production incident
  resolution. See ADR 0033.

- **Capability add-ons — registry + installer** (Phase 1.42).
  Out-of-band heavy components (CLIP / Whisper / Tesseract / Stable
  Diffusion / ComfyUI / Flux / future ML runtimes) ship as
  **first-party add-ons** pulled from a curated registry at
  `add-ons.artist-alley.org` — NOT baked into the binary. Sits
  between integrations (in-process Go) and future plugins (WASM):
  add-ons are heavy artefacts (Docker containers + model weights),
  optional, lifecycle-managed from a `/admin/capabilities` surface.
  Capability-slot model formalises the existing provider
  abstractions (image-embedding, transcription, OCR,
  image-classification, image-generation, image-inpaint, NSFW
  classification); multiple add-ons can satisfy a slot; operator
  picks the active provider. **No GPU gating** — operator hardware
  is operator hardware regardless of license tier; cloud-bridged
  add-ons (we host the inference) are the only tier-gated mode.
  Plugin-style YAML manifest format, plus
  artifact / resource / hosting / config fields. Digest-verified
  pulls; air-gapped operators mirror the registry. Resource
  requirements are advisory, not enforcing. Audit hooks fire
  `addon.*` into Phase 1.40; metrics expose under `addon_` prefix
  in Phase 1.41. Phase 1.42 ships the registry + installer + first
  three add-ons (CLIP for image embeddings, Whisper for
  transcription, Tesseract for OCR) so the surface is meaningful at
  v1. See ADR 0034.

- **Integrations** (Phase 1.18). Real LDAP / SAML / OAuth login
  flows, OAuth applications surface, outbound webhooks, notification
  rules + delivery channels. Extended with:
  **email template engine + send queue** with operator-editable
  templates, **timezone-aware delivery** (digest at 8 AM in the
  recipient's TZ), **event-scoped notifications** that link to a
  triggering record and auto-resolve when it resolves (e.g., a
  pending-request notification disappears when the request is
  approved), **conditional download terms** that show a per-resource
  terms page based on metadata (NDA acknowledgement, watermark
  warning, license summary), and a **dedicated webhook delivery
  worker** — outbound webhooks are queued through the existing job
  system with exponential-backoff retries, per-endpoint signing
  secrets, delivery-log admin surface for inspection + manual
  re-send, dead-letter handling after N failures, and a `webhook.*`
  audit category (Phase 1.40) for every fire / retry / drop. Chat
  platforms (Phase 1.30) plug in as one of the delivery channels
  alongside email / in-app / webhook.

- **Search 2.0** (Phase 1.12). Advanced search builder with
  field-level filters, saved searches, smart collections, synonyms +
  boosts, search analytics. Extended with:
  **saved-search alerts** (notify when results change), **endless
  scrolling** in result views as an alternative to pagination,
  **categorical / faceted refinement** with suggested-keyword
  refinements derived from the result set, **keyboard shortcuts**
  for power-user tagging / review (customizable in account
  settings).

- **Licensing & monetization** (Phase 1.24). Ed25519-signed `.lic`
  files, three tiers (Community 15 active seats / 50k assets, Pro 50
  / 500k, Enterprise unlimited + SSO + audit + multi-tenant + HA +
  priority support). Active-seats defined as `last_active_at` in
  trailing 30 days. Enforcement via tangled value derivation across
  consumers (search quota, upload concurrency, cache sizing, plugin
  gating, federation gating) rather than a single `if valid` gate —
  resilient to casual stripping without obfuscation or binary blobs.
  Cloudflare Workers for signing (private key in Worker Secrets);
  customer portal on Cloudflare Pages. Gated on Phase 1.17 (Identity
  & teams) because seat counting needs `last_active_at`. See ADR 0016
  + ADR 0017.


## On the map

Larger arcs sequenced by dependency + audience — the order here reflects when each becomes valuable, not strict gating:


- **Privacy & consent management** (Phase 1.32). Cookie / tracker
  banner that renders ONLY when a non-essential category is in use
  on the current instance (a bare studio install with no analytics
  shows no banner at all). Categories: essential, functional,
  analytics, third-party embeds. Data Subject Access Request (DSAR)
  tooling: machine-readable JSON export of all personal data,
  soft-then-hard deletion via the scheduled-action engine,
  reassignment of authored content to a `deleted-user` tombstone so
  collaborative content survives. Per-resource-type retention
  policies executed via the same scheduled-action engine. Editable
  `/legal/privacy` and `/legal/terms` markdown surfaces with a
  usable starting template (not legal advice). Privacy is not a
  paid differentiator — Community and Pro both get every feature;
  Enterprise adds non-repudiation signing on the audit-log export.
  See ADR 0024.

- **Share links** (Phase 1.26). Signed, expiring resource + collection
  + post share URLs for external collaborators (contractors,
  publishers, agencies, festival juries) who do not have accounts.
  URL is `GET /share/{token}` where the token is a 32-byte random
  identifier and the share-link row is the source of truth — no
  HMAC signing, so revocation is single-click. Each link binds a
  target (asset / post / collection), a scope (`view` /
  `comment` / `annotate` / `download`), optional `nbf` / `exp`,
  optional Argon2id password, optional max-use ceiling. Per-fetch
  audit trail records IP + user-agent + password result + scope
  satisfied. Downloads stream via presigned URLs on S3-style
  backends; the binary doesn't proxy gigabytes. See ADR 0018.

- **Bulk operations** (Phase 1.27). Multi-select edit / tag / delete /
  move-to-collection / state-transition across the browse feed and
  search results. Floating action bar with persistent selection
  across pagination + a "select all in filter" expansion mode.
  Destructive actions show preview counts and require a typed-count
  confirmation. CSV export of search results with operator-picked
  columns. Contact-sheet PDF generation with configurable grid +
  per-thumb metadata footer. All bulk actions submit as a single
  job-queue job (cancellable, resumable, progress streamed) with
  audit-log entries that preserve the selection IDs for batch undo
  where reversible. See ADR 0019.

- **Asset gating & NDA workflow** (Phase 1.28). Per-asset sensitivity
  tier (`public` / `team` / `restricted` / `embargo`); restricted
  and embargo assets are **server-baked blurred** in browse views —
  the blur is a real preview variant so even a network-tap leak is
  blurred. A "Reveal" button on the asset lifts the blur for the
  session and logs the reveal. Pairs with a generic scheduled-
  action engine (`change_sensitivity`, `restrict`, `delete`,
  `change_state`, `notify` actions on assets / posts / collections /
  users at a future timestamp), executed via the existing job queue.
  Common recipes: NDA expiry on a contractor auto-restricts every
  asset they uploaded; embargo → public flips at a marketing-
  supplied timestamp; trash auto-purges at 30 days. See ADR 0020.

- **Storage tooling** (Phase 1.19). Storage usage dashboard, orphan
  cleanup, checksum verification, dedupe UI, bulk re-import,
  backup + restore, database tools. Extended with:
  **scheduled integrity checks** with off-peak windows (verify the
  bytes on disk match the recorded hash, batched against a
  configurable nightly window), **tiered storage / offline archive**
  (move cold assets to S3 Glacier / tape via a per-bucket policy,
  fetch-on-demand surfaces), **per-download bandwidth tracking** so
  storage cost can be attributed to teams / users.

- **Reports & analytics** (Phase 1.20). Asset usage, user activity,
  storage trends, job performance, custom dashboards, scheduled
  reports, drafts, trash, activity log surfaces. Extended with: **custom SQL report builder** with placeholder
  variables (date range, team, user), **CSV / Excel / PDF export**
  per report, **report thumbnails** rendered server-side for the
  reports list, **per-collection download analytics**, **scheduled
  email delivery** of any report on a cron expression.

- **Community & moderation** (Phase 1.21). Reports queue, comment
  moderation, banned users / IPs, anonymous browse policy, rate
  limits, bookmarks. Extended with: **comment
  flagging with reason tracking** (spam, abuse, sensitive content,
  off-topic — configurable list), **email escalation to admins** on
  flagged content, **per-comment hide / restore** with audit trail,
  **activity stream surfaced as a structured comments thread** on
  the post-detail modal (system events become quoted-style entries
  alongside human comments — an activity-log-to-comments pattern),
  **structured support intake** — `/contact` form with
  categorization (bug / feature / abuse / account help / other) feeds
  into the same moderation queue with assignment, status tracking,
  and SLA timers; replaces the loose "email the admin" pattern with
  a queryable surface, and a **personal activity feed** on the user
  dashboard surfacing followed posts, recently viewed assets,
  bookmarks, pending notifications, and the user's own recent
  uploads + comments — pulled from the audit log (Phase 1.40)
  filtered to the user's visibility scope.

- **Announcements home widget** (Phase 1.37). Operator-authored
  announcements with audience scoping (`org` / `team:{name}` /
  `role:{name}`), severity tiers (info / notice / warning /
  critical), optional schedule (`nbf` / `exp`), pinning, and per-user
  read state. Homepage hero strip shows the top three active for the
  user; account dashboard tile shows the full list with read state.
  Auto-fed from system events — planned maintenance, license upgrade,
  failed scheduled jobs, federation peer offline — become
  announcements automatically. Chat platforms (Phase 1.30) mirror
  new announcements to the configured Slack channel. See ADR 0029.

- **Chat platform integrations** (Phase 1.30). Slack first, then
  Teams + Discord via the same provider abstraction. Outbound: rich
  Block-Kit-style messages for every notifiable event with
  deep-link buttons back into the post-detail modal. Inbound:
  `/aa search <query>`, `/aa post <id>`, `/aa upload` slash
  commands. Unfurl: Artist Alley URLs in chat get rich previews with
  blur respect for sensitive content. DM notifications opt-in via
  per-user Slack account connect. Admin surface defines per-event
  channel routing rules (`event:upload.completed in team:Concept Art
  → #concept-art-feed`). Chat is a delivery channel within the
  existing notification-rule subsystem from Phase 1.18 — not a
  separate engine. See ADR 0022.

- **External platform integrations** (Phase 1.29). Provider-
  abstraction layer for outbound publishing and inbound asset
  ingestion against Vimeo, YouTube, Adobe Creative Cloud Libraries,
  and Falcon.io. Each provider is a Go package in
  `app/internal/platforms/<name>/` implementing a common interface
  (publish / pull / sync / embed / webhook). Linked-asset model
  stores `platform_links[]` on the resource row so the post-detail
  modal shows "Published to Vimeo (in sync)" and flags drift /
  deletion. Pull-as-asset uses the same `origin_*` row flag that
  federation does — the storage layer doesn't care whether content
  came from a peer AA or an external platform. OAuth client secrets
  in Cloudflare Worker Secrets; per-studio refresh tokens encrypted
  at rest. License tier caps concurrent platform connections via the
  tangled-derivation model. See ADR 0021.

- **RSS / Atom feeds** (Phase 1.31). Standard syndication for
  collections, saved searches, user uploads, and tags so studios can
  wire Artist Alley into feed readers, Slack / Teams / Discord
  RSS connectors, and Zapier / n8n / Make / IFTTT triggers with no
  custom integration. URLs: `/feed/collection/{slug}.atom`,
  `/feed/search/{id}.atom`, `/feed/user/{handle}/uploads.atom`,
  `/feed/tag/{slug}.atom`. Atom primary, RSS 2.0 for compatibility.
  Per-user feed token in the URL for non-public content; revocable
  in account settings. Embargo + restricted items filter out of
  feeds entirely. Server-side cache 5 min with ETag + If-Modified-
  Since. See ADR 0023.

- **AI creative editing** (Phase 1.34). Provider-abstracted in-paint,
  out-paint, variations, and remove-background tools in the asset
  viewer's Creative tools panel. Providers: OpenAI (DALL-E +
  GPT-Image), Stability AI, ComfyUI local (for studios who keep
  pixels on-network). Generated images are **new assets** that share
  a `creative_lineage` relationship with the source — the source is
  never overwritten. The new asset's metadata records provider,
  prompt, seed, and parameters for both licensing and audit. License
  tier governs which providers are available + monthly token budgets.
  Community: ComfyUI local only. Pro: + OpenAI + Stability with
  caps. Enterprise: unlimited + bring-your-own API keys. See
  ADR 0026. **Status:** first realization shipped 2026-06-22 as
  Phase 1.14.E-1 (PR #156) — `img2img` via the ComfyUI MCP bridge
  using the ADR 0051 MCP-mediated path, `creative_lineage` table
  live (migration 00014), viewer trigger via `Img2ImgPopover`,
  bridge at `tools/comfyui-mcp-bridge/` with Flux Kontext example
  validated end-to-end. Remaining ops + mask UI ship in 1.14.E-2;
  OpenAI / Stability providers + tier gating in 1.14.E-3 (gated on
  licensing arc).

- **Artist Alley as an MCP server** (Phase 1.52). Expose the
  instance's asset catalogue via the Model Context Protocol so AI
  coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) and creative
  agents can query and reason over a studio's archive the same way
  they query a codebase. Surface includes typed MCP tools for
  asset search by tag / sensitivity / collection, similarity search
  via the Phase 1.14.B CLIP embeddings, collection-context retrieval
  (asset list + metadata + relationships in one call), and
  multi-asset summarisation through the Phase 1.14.A provider
  abstraction. Authenticated via the existing API-token surface
  with a new `mcp.use` capability; per-tool capability gates so
  operators can expose only the surface they're comfortable with.
  Federation-aware: the MCP server can resolve cross-instance
  references via the existing federation actor URIs. Sibling
  concept to the [codebase-memory-mcp](https://github.com/DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp)
  pattern but for asset catalogues rather than source code. See
  ADR 0050. Depends on Phase 1.14.A (provider abstraction) +
  Phase 1.14.B (CLIP embeddings) shipping first.

- **Artist Alley as an MCP client** (Phase 1.53). The inverse of
  Phase 1.52 — instead of exposing AA's catalogue to external
  agents, AA's own AI orchestrator consumes external Model Context
  Protocol servers as tool sources. Adds `mcp_server` as a new
  provider kind to the Phase 1.14.A AI provider abstraction:
  operator registers an MCP server (URL + auth + capability
  scoping); its tools become callable from job handlers + workflow
  rules + admin actions. Validation references:
  [SceneWeaver's tessa-mcp / comfyui-mcp pattern](https://github.com/Artist-Alley-Org/artist-alley/blob/dev/docs/adr/0051-artist-alley-as-mcp-client.md)
  (each external service wrapped as a dedicated MCP server; AA
  orchestrates). Initial integration target: **ComfyUI MCP** for
  studios who run local image-generation infrastructure (clean
  complement to Phase 1.34's hosted image-edit providers). Generic
  MCP-server registration means any operator-built bridge plugs
  in without per-tool code in AA. Per-server + per-tool capability
  gates so operators control exposure precisely. Inherits the
  Phase 1.14.A audit + cost-tracking + privacy-routing
  infrastructure — every MCP tool call records to `ai_provider_call`
  with the MCP-server name as the "provider" + the tool name as
  the "model." Local-only by default; no MCP traffic federates.
  See ADR 0051. **Status:** foundation shipped 2026-06-21 as Phase
  1.53.A (PR #154) — registration tables + dispatcher 6-step guard
  chain + `mcp.client.{use,admin,images.read,images.write}` capabilities
  + health checker + JSON-RPC over HTTP provider + admin UI at
  `/admin/ai/mcp-clients`. First internal caller shipped 2026-06-22
  as Phase 1.14.E-1 (PR #156) — `aiedit` subsystem dispatching
  `img2img` through the bridge. ADR 0051 status flipped to `accepted`.

- **Featured collections & homepage curation** (Phase 1.35). Tree
  edges on the collection model (`collection_parent_id`, capped at
  depth 5) + a `featured` boolean with `team` / `org` / `public`
  scope. The same tree powers the team dashboard, the global signed-
  in homepage, and the anonymous public landing — one model, three
  audiences. Each featured node has an optional `hero_asset_id` (the
  card cover) and a `featured_order` integer for sibling sort.
  Cascade-publish flips a parent + children at once. Public featured
  collections respect per-asset sensitivity from ADR 0020 — an
  `embargo` asset shows only its title until embargo lifts. See
  ADR 0027.

- **Brand workspace** (Phase 1.33). Curated overlay on the
  collection + theme model: a `brand_kit` binds a set of canonical
  collections, an editable design-token export (CSS / Tailwind /
  JSON / Figma tokens v3), a markdown guidelines doc with inline
  asset blocks, per-asset usage rules (`internal-only` / `partner`
  / `press` / `public`), and a publish state. Public portal at
  `/brand/{slug}`. Token export at `/brand/{slug}/tokens.json` for
  automated pipelines. Brand-steward role is Pro+; everyone can
  read. Usage rules enforced through the Phase 1.18 conditional
  download terms. See ADR 0025.

- **PBR 3D viewer polish** (Phase 1.36). Right-side inspector in
  `ModelView.svelte` review mode: per-material list with hide / solo
  toggles, editable live PBR params (base color, metallic, roughness,
  normal strength, emissive) with the source asset never written,
  per-map texture preview that hand-offs to the texture inspector
  (Phase 1.18.B-16), curated 8-pack of IBL HDR environments + a
  project-HDR picker, A / B wipe between two materials on the same
  mesh (reusing the 1.18.B-8 A/B compare primitives). Override sets
  export as a structured `material_review.json` attached to the post
  — engineers ingesting reviews don't have to parse prose. See ADR
  0028.

- **Federation** (Phase 1.22). Federation v1 shipped (1.22.A-D wire
  protocol + inbox/outbox, encryption arc 1.22.I); phase-2 items are
  tracked in epic #287.

- **Plugin ecosystem** (Phase 1.23). WASM extension model via
  Extism. In-tree Go packages until external authors arrive.

- **Sized feed slots** (epic #745, **ADR 0079**) — the placement primitive
  underneath both ads and premium placement. A slot is a *position*, a
  *size in grid units* (2×2), and an *ordered fill chain*; ads, promoted
  premium posts and operator curation are **consumers**, not three
  implementations. Load-bearing rule: an unfilled slot becomes ordinary
  feed content, never a hole — so ADR 0030's "collapse the empty slot"
  now applies per slot kind. Sequenced #746 (uniform grid, cheap — works
  today) → #747 (masonry rework; a tile currently *cannot* span, per the
  #651 append-stability trade) → #748 (wire the fill sources).

- **Operator-configurable ad slots** (Phase 1.38). Opt-in surface for
  operators running public-facing community instances (fan sites,
  festival hubs, art-school portfolios) to monetize hosting via ads.
  Defined zones across feed top / between-every-Nth feed item /
  sidebar top + bottom / post-modal sidebar / footer; each zone is
  toggled and provider-bound per instance. *In-grid 2×2 slots are a
  separate kind, added by ADR 0079 — the zones listed here are
  page-margin banners.* Providers ship for Google
  AdSense, Meta Audience Network, Carbon Ads, EthicalAds, and a
  custom-HTML option. Default off everywhere; AAA-internal studios
  see zero ad markup. Operator allow-lists categories (block
  gambling / adult / political / whatever) + sets frequency rules
  (min N feed items between inline ads, max ads per page,
  time-of-day windows). Privacy compliance: ad slots auto-enable the
  third-party-embeds category in the cookie banner (ADR 0024) and
  do NOT load until consent. Per-user opt-out in account settings;
  Pro / Enterprise tiers may auto-suppress ads for paid users at the
  operator's option. **No revenue share** — operator ad income is
  theirs. **No anti-AdBlock measures** — blocked users get a clean
  view, no fight. Ad slots are sandboxed iframes with reserved
  dimensions to avoid CLS. All tiers — Community can monetize a
  public instance the same as Pro / Enterprise. See ADR 0030.

- **Commerce — Stripe + Shopify** (Phase 1.39). Operator-side commerce
  for selling content directly: digital downloads (concept-art packs,
  asset bundles, soundtracks), print-on-demand merchandise, physical
  originals, subscription access to WIP / patron tiers. Provider-
  abstracted with Stripe (direct, digital + physical + subscription),
  Shopify (full storefront for physical + tax + shipping), and
  Gumroad (lightweight digital + subscription) at launch. Listings
  attach to assets, posts, collections, or brand-kit items with
  pricing, delivery type, and a license-grant clause. Digital
  fulfillment reuses Phase 1.26 share links — buyer gets a single-
  use signed link with a 90-day expiry after payment. Subscription
  access expires via Phase 1.28's scheduled-action engine. Tax,
  refunds, disputes all defer to the payment processor. License-
  tier caps active-listing count (Community 5, Pro 500, Enterprise
  unlimited + organization-level Stripe / Shopify accounts).
  Per-instance public storefront at `/shop/{slug}` aggregates all
  active listings. **No revenue share** — operator's sales go to
  operator's bank; AA's monetization is per-tier license fees, the
  same stance as Phase 1.38 ads. Federated peers can surface remote
  listings read-only with a "buy on origin" CTA; federated checkout
  is out of scope. See ADR 0031.
## Things we deliberately aren't building

- A general-purpose DAM. We're shaped specifically for studio
  art-review workflows.
- A pipeline integration platform. We're a destination for finished
  and in-progress art, not a Perforce / Shotgrid replacement.
- A hosted-only SaaS product. We're self-hosted by design — a
  managed hosted Pro offering is on the table for indie studios who
  don't want to run their own infra, but the product remains
  fully self-hostable, and Enterprise customers self-host
  exclusively.
